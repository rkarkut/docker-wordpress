This year is no exception, as <a href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/wordpress-2017-survey\">the 2017 WordPress User Survey</a> is out now.</p>\n<p>The information collected in the survey is used to make informed decisions about improvements across the WordPress project, so your answers are incredibly valuable and help shape the future of the platform.</p>\n<h2>WordPress 4.8.3 Security Release</h2>\n<p>At the end of October, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/10/wordpress-4-8-3-security-release/\">WordPress 4.8.3 was released</a> containing an important security fix for all previous versions of WordPress. If your WordPress installation has not updated automatically, please update it now to protect your site.</p>\n<p>This security issue was brought to light by a community member, so if you ever discover a security vulnerability in WordPress core, please do the same and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/\">disclose it responsibly</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordPress 4.9 Nearly Ready for Release</h2>\n<p>WordPress 4.9 was in rapid development this month. We released four beta versions and published a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/10/wordpress-4-9-release-candidate/\">release candidate</a>. The target for shipping WordPress 4.9 is November 14 — just two short weeks away. With many new features, this is a hugely exciting release that improves WordPress’ user experience considerably. Notably, you’ll see <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/10/24/a-new-themes-experience-in-the-customizer/\">improvements to the theme selection experience</a>, plenty of <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/10/24/widget-improvements-in-wordpress-4-9/\">widget enhancements</a>, drastically improved <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/10/22/code-editing-improvements-in-wordpress-4-9/\">code editing</a>, and much better <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/10/15/improvements-for-roles-and-capabilities-in-4-9/\">user role management</a>.</p>\n<p>To get involved in building WordPress Core, jump into the #core channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>, and follow <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">the Core team blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Charity Hackathons are Growing</h2>\n<p>For the last few years, the number of <a href=\"https://doaction.org/\">do_action series of WordPress charity hackathons</a> has grown around the world. What started as a community event to assist local nonprofit organizations, has become something many WordPress communities are replicating in an increasing number of cities.</p>\n<p>As of this month, do_action events have been hosted in Cape Town and Johannesburg, South Africa, Beirut, Lebanon, Austin, Texas, and Montréal, Canada. In addition, events are now scheduled for <a href=\"https://doaction.org/event/bristol-2018/\">Bristol, England</a> and <a href=\"https://doaction.org/event/zurich-2018/\">Zurich, Switzerland</a> in 2018.</p>\n<p>To get involved in organizing a do_action event locally, read <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/do_action-charity-hackathon/\">the do_action organizer’s handbook</a> and join the #community-events channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>Gutenberg Development Advances</h2>\n<p>While work steadily continues on Gutenberg — the new editor for WordPress core — one update from this month addresses one of the primary concerns that some people shared about the project.</p>\n<p>Up until <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/10/24/whats-new-in-gutenberg-24th-october/\">the release on October 24</a>, Gutenberg did not support the meta boxes that so many WordPress content creators rely on. The new editor now has initial support for meta boxes as well as a host of other critical features for content creation in WordPress.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/\">Test out Gutenberg</a> right now and help develop it by joining the #core-editor channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a> and following the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Core team blog</a>.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n<h2>Further Reading:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>DonateWC, a new initiative that assists people in attending WordCamps, <a href=\"https://donatewc.org/wordcamp-stories/wordcamp-cape-town-experience/\">sponsored Trust Nhokovedzo from Harare, Zimbabwe</a> to speak at WordCamp Cape Town, South Africa this month.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/2017/10/saying-goodbye-to-canvas/\">The popular Canvas theme was retired</a> this month to allow WooCommerce to focus on moving their products forward more effectively.</li>\n<li>The next installment of Camp Press, the WordPress community retreat event, will take place <a href=\"https://camp.press/event/iceland2018/\">in Iceland</a>.</li>\n<li>If you run a WordPress meetup group, but are struggling to find content for your events, the WordPress Marketing team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/10/04/supporting-for-meetups-with-low-content/\">has put together some ideas</a> to help.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://2017.us.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp US 2017</a> is just around the corner — there’s still time to grab your tickets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>If you have a story we should consider including in the next “Month in WordPress” post, please <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/\">submit it here</a>.</em></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"5044\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"WordPress 4.8.3 Security Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/10/wordpress-4-8-3-security-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 31 Oct 2017 14:20:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Security\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"4.8\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=5035\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:378:\"WordPress 4.8.3 is now available.

We’ve been working on making it even easier to customize your site. Here are some of the bigger items to test and help us find as many bugs as possible in the coming weeks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drafting (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39896\">#39896</a>) and scheduling (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/28721\">#28721</a>) of changes in the Customizer. Once you save or schedule a changeset, when any user comes into the Customizer the pending changes will be autoloaded. A button is provided to discard changes to restore the Customizer to the last published state. (This is a new “linear” mode for changesets, as opposed to “branching” mode which can be enabled by filter so that every time  user opens the Customizer a new blank changeset will be started.)</li>\n<li>Addition of a frontend preview link to the Customizer to allow changes to be browsed on the frontend, even without a user being logged in (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39896\">#39896</a>).</li>\n<li>Addition of autosave revisions in the Customizer (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39275\">#39275</a>).</li>\n<li>A brand new theme browsing experience in the Customizer (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37661\">#37661</a>).</li>\n<li>Gallery widget (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41914\">#41914</a>), following the media and image widgets introduced in 4.8.</li>\n<li>Support for shortcodes in Text widgets (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10457\">#10457</a>).</li>\n<li>Support for adding media to Text widgets (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40854\">#40854</a>).</li>\n<li>Support for adding oEmbeds outside post content, including Text widgets (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/34115\">#34115</a>).</li>\n<li>Support for videos from providers other than YouTube and Vimeo in the Video widget (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/42039\">#42039</a>)</li>\n<li>Improve the flow for creating new menus in the Customizer (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40104\">#40104</a>).</li>\n<li>Educated guess mapping of nav menus and widgets when switching themes (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39692\">#39692</a>).</li>\n<li>Plugins: Introduce singular capabilities for activating and deactivating individual plugins (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38652\">#38652</a>).</li>\n<li>Sandbox PHP file edits in both plugins and themes, without auto-deactivation when an error occurs; a PHP edit that introduces a fatal error is rolled back with an opportunity then for the user to fix the error and attempt to re-save. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21622\">#21622</a>).</li>\n<li>Addition of dirty state for widgets on the admin screen, indicating when a widget has been successfully saved and showing an “Are you sure?” dialog when attempting to leave without saving changes.

Integration includes support for linters to catch errors before you attempt to save. Includes new APIs for plugins to instantiate editors. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12423\">#12423</a>)</li>\n<li>Introduction of an extensible code editor control for adding instances of CodeMirror to the Customizer. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41897\">#41897</a>)</li>\n<li>Addition of global notifications area (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/35210\">#35210</a>), panel and section notifications (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38794\">#38794</a>), and a notification overlay that takes over the entire screen in the Customizer (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37727\">#37727</a>).</li>\n<li>A date/time control in the Customizer (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/42022\">#42022</a>).</li>\n<li>Improve usability of Customize JS API (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/42083\">#42083</a>, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37964\">#37964</a>, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/36167\">#36167</a>).</li>\n<li>Introduction of control templates for base controls (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30738\">#30738</a>).</li>\n<li>Use WP_Term_Query when transforming tax queries (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37038\">#37038</a>).</li>\n<li>Database: Add support for MySQL servers connecting to IPv6 hosts (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41722\">#41722</a>).</li>\n<li>Emoji: Bring Twemoji compatibility to PHP (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/35293\">#35293</a>).

Still, the WordPress Core team is exploring a move <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2463\">to make WordPress framework-agnostic</a>, so that the framework being used could be replaced by any other framework without affecting the rest of the project.</p>\n<p>This is a bold move that will ultimately make WordPress core a lot more flexible, and will also protect it from potential license changes in the future.</p>\n<p>You can get involved in the JavaScript discussion by joining the #core-js channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a> and following the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">WordPress Core development blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>Community Initiative to Make WordCamps More Accessible</h2>\n<p>A WordPress community member, Ines van Essen, started a new nonprofit initiative to offer financial assistance to community members to attend WordCamps. <a href=\"https://donatewc.org/\">DonateWC</a> launched with a crowdsourced funding campaign to cover the costs of getting things up and running.</p>\n<p>Now that she’s raised the initial funds, Ines plans to set up a nonprofit organization and use donations from sponsors to help people all over the world attend and speak at WordCamps.</p>\n<p>If you would like to support the initiative, you can do so by <a href=\"https://donatewc.org/make-a-donation/\">donating through their website</a>.</p>\n<h2>The WordCamp Incubator Program Returns</h2>\n<p>Following the success of <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/06/30/wordcamp-incubator-report/\">the first WordCamp Incubator Program</a>, the Community Team is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/09/27/wordcamp-incubator-program-v2-new-role-name/\">bringing the program back</a> to assist more underserved cities in kick-starting their WordPress communities.</p>\n<p>The program’s first phase aims to find community members who will volunteer to mentor, assist, and work alongside local leaders in the incubator communities — this is a time-intensive volunteer role that would need to be filled by experienced WordCamp organizers.</p>\n<p>If you would like to be a part of this valuable initiative, join the #community-team channel in

href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/\">Global WordPress Translation Day</a>, a 24-hour, round-the-clock, digital and physical global marathon dedicated to the localisation and internationalisation of the WordPress platform and ecosystem, a structure that powers, today, over 28% of all existing websites.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The localisation process allows for WordPress and for all WordPress-related products (themes and plugins) to be available in local languages, so to improve their accessibility and usage and to allow as many people as possible to take advantage of the free platform and services available.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In a (not completely) serendipitous coincidence, September 30 has also been declared by the United Nations “International Translation Day”, to pay homage to the great services of translators everywhere, one that allows communication and exchange.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The event will feature a series of multi-language live speeches (training sessions, tutorials, case histories, etc.) that will be screen-casted in streaming, starting from Australia and the Far East and ending in the Western parts of the United States.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In that same 24-hour time frame, Polyglots worldwide will gather physically in local events, for dedicated training and translations sprints (and for some fun and socializing as well), while those unable to physically join their teams will do so remotely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A big, fun, useful and enlightening party and a lovely mix of growing, giving, learning and teaching, to empower, and cultivate, and shine.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Here are some stats about the first two events:</span></p>\n<p><b>Global WordPress Translation Day 1</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">448 translators

Read on to learn more about what the WordPress project accomplished during the month of October.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n<h2>Take the 2017 Annual WordPress User Survey</h2>\n<p>The annual WordPress User Survey is a great opportunity for you to provide your feedback about how you use WordPress. This year is no exception, as <a href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/wordpress-2017-survey\">the 2017 WordPress User Survey</a> is out now.</p>\n<p>The information collected in the survey is used to make informed decisions about improvements across the WordPress project, so your answers are incredibly valuable and help shape the future of the platform.</p>\n<h2>WordPress 4.8.3 Security Release</h2>\n<p>At the end of October, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/10/wordpress-4-8-3-security-release/\">WordPress 4.8.3 was released</a> containing an important security fix for all previous versions of WordPress. If your WordPress installation has not updated automatically, please update it now to protect your site.</p>\n<p>This security issue was brought to light by a community member, so if you ever discover a security vulnerability in WordPress core, please do the same and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/\">disclose it responsibly</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordPress 4.9 Nearly Ready for Release</h2>\n<p>WordPress 4.9 was in rapid development this month. We released four beta versions and published a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/10/wordpress-4-9-release-candidate/\">release candidate</a>. The target for shipping WordPress 4.9 is November 14 — just two short weeks away. With many new features, this is a hugely exciting release that improves WordPress’ user experience considerably. Notably, you’ll see <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/10/24/a-new-themes-experience-in-the-customizer/\">improvements to the theme selection experience</a>, plenty of <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/10/24/widget-improvements-in-wordpress-4-9/\">widget enhancements</a>, drastically improved <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/10/22/code-editing-improvements-in-wordpress-4-9/\">code editing</a>, and much better <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/10/15/improvements-for-roles-and-capabilities-in-4-9/\">user role management</a>.</p>\n<p>To get involved in building WordPress Core, jump into the #core channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>, and follow <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">the Core team blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Charity Hackathons are Growing</h2>\n<p>For the last few years, the number of <a href=\"https://doaction.org/\">do_action series of WordPress charity hackathons</a> has grown around the world. What started as a community event to assist local nonprofit organizations, has become something many WordPress communities are replicating in an increasing number of cities.</p>\n<p>As of this month, do_action events have been hosted in Cape Town and Johannesburg, South Africa, Beirut, Lebanon, Austin, Texas, and Montréal, Canada. In addition, events are now scheduled for <a href=\"https://doaction.org/event/bristol-2018/\">Bristol, England</a> and <a href=\"https://doaction.org/event/zurich-2018/\">Zurich, Switzerland</a> in 2018.</p>\n<p>To get involved in organizing a do_action event locally, read <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/do_action-charity-hackathon/\">the do_action organizer’s handbook</a> and join the #community-events channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>Gutenberg Development Advances</h2>\n<p>While work steadily continues on Gutenberg — the new editor for WordPress core — one update from this month addresses one of the primary concerns that some people shared about the project.</p>\n<p>Up until <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/10/24/whats-new-in-gutenberg-24th-october/\">the release on October 24</a>, Gutenberg did not support the meta boxes that so many WordPress content creators rely on. The new editor now has initial support for meta boxes as well as a host of other critical features for content creation in WordPress.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/\">Test out Gutenberg</a> right now and help develop it by joining the #core-editor channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a> and following the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Core team blog</a>.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n<h2>Further Reading:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>DonateWC, a new initiative that assists people in attending WordCamps, <a href=\"https://donatewc.org/wordcamp-stories/wordcamp-cape-town-experience/\">sponsored Trust Nhokovedzo from Harare, Zimbabwe</a> to speak at WordCamp Cape Town, South Africa this month.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/2017/10/saying-goodbye-to-canvas/\">The popular Canvas theme was retired</a> this month to allow WooCommerce to focus on moving their products forward more effectively.</li>\n<li>The next installment of Camp Press, the WordPress community retreat event, will take place <a href=\"https://camp.press/event/iceland2018/\">in Iceland</a>.</li>\n<li>If you run a WordPress meetup group, but are struggling to find content for your events, the WordPress Marketing team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/10/04/supporting-for-meetups-with-low-content/\">has put together some ideas</a> to help.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://2017.us.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp US 2017</a> is just around the corner — there’s still time to grab your tickets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>If you have a story we should consider including in the next “Month in WordPress” post, please <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/\">submit it here</a>.</em></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 02 Nov 2017 12:02:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Hugh Lashbrooke\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:97:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 1.6 Improves Writing Experience, Moves Block Toolbar to the Top of the Editor\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=76182\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-1-6-improves-writing-experience-moves-block-toolbar-to-the-top-of-the-editor\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6408:\"<p>The Gutenberg plugin&#8217;s Halloween release (<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/10/31/whats-new-in-gutenberg-31st-october/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">version 1.6</a>) includes major updates to the writing experience and many performance improvements. The block toolbar has been <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2998\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">relocated to the top of the editor</a>, a suggestion that was mocked up and described in detail in a post on the Yoast SEO blog proposing <a href=\"https://yoast.com/gutenberg-alternative-approach/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">an alternative approach for Gutenberg</a>.</p>\n<p>Prior to version 1.6, users could inadvertantly end up in a situation like the screenshot below &#8211; with tools and toggles popping into view from all sides of a block.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-01-at-5.17.46-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>Gutenberg prior to version 1.6\n<p>Previously, any small mouse move would pull the block toolbar back into view, which made for a somewhat jarring writing experience. Gutenberg 1.6 makes the block toolbar completely independent of the content by fixing it to the top of the editor. This move reduces the amount of visual distraction in the writing zone, while keeping the toolbar accessible in a way that is familiar to users coming from the Classic Editor.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-01-at-5.24.34-PM-e1509575932134.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The toolbar will automatically adjust to display tools specific to the block type that is in focus, so that users don&#8217;t have to sift through other tools that are not applicable to that specific type of content. It does not show if no blocks are selected.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gutenberg-block-toolbar.gif?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>In the ticket proposing the change, Gutenberg designer Joen Asmussen describes it as part of a larger effort to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/2983\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">try to reduce the visual weight of the block</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The cognitive load of the chrome we show around and in context of the block unit has been an ongoing topic for a while,&#8221; Asmussen said. &#8220;Concerns have been noted that it feels heavy, there are many toolbars, options, and it gets in the way of writing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Placing the block toolbar to the top of the editor is a strong move toward making blocks feel lighter, and version 1.6 includes several other UI tweaks along the same theme. It introduces an alternate style for block boundaries and multi-selection that removes the previous hover and selected styles for blocks, which were somewhat heavy-handed and distracting. Instead, hovering over blocks will simply bring the floating settings dots into view on the side of the block. Contributors also redesigned the selection styles to be more subtle, making the separator, more, and button UI items feel more lightweight.</p>\n<p>Other visual changes include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Engage &#8220;edit&#8221; mode when using arrow keys (hides UI)</li>\n<li>Complete rework of arrow keys navigation between blocks—faster, clearer, and respects caret position while traversing text blocks</li>\n<li>Added keyboard shortcuts to navigate regions</li>\n<li>Implement multi-selection mode using just arrow with shift keys and support horizontal arrows</li>\n<li>Change visual style of multi-selected blocks so it has the same color as highlighted text does</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Gutenberg 1.6 introduces the ability to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/3179\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">convert a classic block (post) into several Gutenblocks</a>. The resulting divided block is fairly instantaneous.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-01-at-6.47.03-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-1-5-adds-initial-support-for-meta-boxes-makes-gutenberg-the-default-editor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Version 1.5</a> of the plugin added initial support for meta boxes in an Extended Settings panel beneath the post content. Version 1.6 changes the UI to make meta boxes part of the main column, instead of a collapsible box. Plugin developers had complained that the UI gave the impression of having been pinned to the bottom as &#8220;a bit of an afterthought.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think the current design does meta boxes a real disservice,&#8221; one tester, Patrick B., <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-1-5-adds-initial-support-for-meta-boxes-makes-gutenberg-the-default-editor#comment-238575\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">commented</a> on our post. &#8220;The current layout and the section heading, “Extended Settings,” makes it look and feel like a bit of an afterthought. Undoubtably, many meta boxes will be able to be moved to their own blocks, but there will still be situations where what is contained under Extended Settings is essential to putting together a page but isn’t appropriate as a block. In that case, Extended Settings just doesn’t feel right and seems easily forgettable. That could create an awkward publishing experience, especially when those fields are required to publish.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Meta boxes now appear below the content without the Extended Settings label and individual accordion items are toggled closed by default. The bottom section appears regardless of whether or not the sidebar Settings panel is toggled open, so it is always there. This is a change from the previous release where toggling the sidebar Settings panel open was required to see the Extended Settings panel.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-01-at-7.04.00-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Gutenberg 1.6 is a fairly large release with several dozen fixes and performance improvements.

If you&#8217;re just now getting started on your journey to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2015-javascript-and-api-driven-interfaces-are-the-future-of-wordpress\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">learning JavaScript deeply</a>, this 23-lesson video course from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrisoncode\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Sevilleja</a> offers a quick foundation on the basics with 4.7 hours of learning and hands-on practice.</p>\n<p>The course includes lessons that introduce students to the following concepts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Types and Variables</li>\n<li>Operators</li>\n<li>Comparisons</li>\n<li>Conditionals, Flow, and Loops</li>\n<li>Functions</li>\n<li>Objects</li>\n<li>Built-in Objects</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After completing the fundamentals, students move on to build a couple of starter applications. At the end of the course Sevilleja guides students through building a bookmarking type application for grabbing links from the web and storing them in local storage. Code for the course is available on GitHub and requires a basic set of tools: a browser with support for ES6 features, DevTools and the console, and a code editor.</p>\n<p>The course is targeted at those who have already learned HTML and CSS but don&#8217;t know JavaScript yet. It&#8217;s also helpful for developers who have jumped into jQuery, Angular, React, or other libraries but haven&#8217;t taken the time to learn the core language first.</p>\n<p>The Scotch School has two other free courses at the moment: <a href=\"https://scotch.io/courses/10-need-to-know-javascript-concepts\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">10 Need to Know JavaScript Concepts</a> and <a href=\"https://scotch.io/courses/build-an-online-shop-with-vue\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Build an Online Shop with Vue</a>.

Kim Parsell, 1956-2015\" /><p>There are times when I hear a story from the WordPress community and I think &#8220;That&#8217;s a HeroPress story&#8221;, whether it has been or ever will actually be posted on the site. Some stories are just so great that you think &#8220;Wow, that&#8217;s just really great&#8221;. This week&#8217;s essay is one of those stories, but it won&#8217;t be told by the person it&#8217;s about.</p>\n<p>Kim Parsell has one of my absolute favorite HeroPress stories, but we lost her before HeroPress was even properly started. I&#8217;ve keenly felt the loss of the wisdom and joy she would have brought to HeroPress. I only met her in person once, at the last WordCamp San Francisco. She was so very much in her element, even I could see it, who barely knew her.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve literally spent years now, trying to think of an appropriate way to share her story on HeroPress, and I think this year I found it. The WordPress community was Kim&#8217;s family, and she was our mom. I&#8217;m going to let some of the people closest to her tell some of her story.</p>\n<p>&#8212; Topher</p>\n<blockquote class=\"light\"><p><em>From Jeff Chandler</em></p>\n<p>What did the WordPress community mean to Kim Parsell? Family.</p>\n<p>In order to understand how highly valued the WordPress community was to Kim Parsell, you first have to realize her environment.</p>\n<p>Kim was a middle-aged woman who lived off a dirt road, on top of a hill, in Southern rural Ohio. She was often by herself, taking care of the property with only a few neighbors up and down the road.</p>\n<p>She received internet access from towers that broadcasted wireless signals, similar to cell phones but at lower speeds.</p>\n<p>Through WordPress Weekly, Kim gained access to members of the WordPress community where she was able to talk to them on a weekly basis. The show and its after hours sessions provided Kim a chance to mingle with the who&#8217;s who of WordPress at the time. It helped establish long-lasting relationships that would open up future opportunities.</p>\n<p>In a location where not many around her used or even heard of WordPress, the community was an outlet for her to be around like-minded people. Kim had a blast interacting with people online and at WordCamp events. Many members of the WordPress community became her second family, a responsibility she took very seriously.</p></blockquote>\n<hr />\n<a href=\"http://www.kpimages.net/index.php?showimage=248\"><img class=\"wp-image-2243 size-full\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/20071025160711_dscf2405-pano.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"950\" height=\"500\" /></a>My Backyard, Revisited &#8211; 10/25/2007 &#8211; Kim Parsell<br /> Autumn&#8217;s patchwork quilt has finally descended upon this area &#8211; the trees are in full fall color. This was taken yesterday morning. I tried to take this from just about the same vantage point as the previous one &#8211; I think I got pretty close!<br /> Copyright © 2007 Kim Parsell.

I told him I remembered a whole lot more about how she made me feel versus how she felt about WordPress and the community. (I suppose the saying is true that people don&#8217;t remember what you say, they remember how you made them feel).</p>\n<p>I first remember meeting Kim on Twitter, so I went back and did a search to the earliest <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%40cdils%20AND%20%40kimparsell&src=typd&lang=en\">conversations of ours</a> I could find. They dated back to January 2013, nearly two years to the date after she passed in January 2015. I will always remember Kim, along with Mika Epstein and Andrea Rennick, for their kindness to me when I was new to the community. They were the first &#8220;women of WordPress&#8221; to draw me in and make me feel at home simply by sharing themselves and their knowledge.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s what community is, right? You share things that are personal, vulnerable even. You share your experiences. In doing that, you naturally invite others to reciprocate. That&#8217;s the environment Kim created with hundreds of others, not just me. Affectionately called #wpmom, Kim was an investor. She invested countless hours into the WordPress project (she had &#8220;props&#8221; for 5 major releases of WP and also volunteered her time for the documentation team). She invested in women who wanted to break into tech. She invested in me.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://carriedils.com/for-you-kim/\">I still well up with tears</a> when I remember Kim. I&#8217;m proud that the WordPress Foundation now offers a scholarship in her memory. She loved this community and this community loved her right back. Her legacy lives on&#8230;</p></blockquote>\n<hr />\n<a href=\"http://www.kpimages.net/index.php?showimage=243\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2244\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/20070930095922_dscf0913.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" /></a>Eastern Tiger &#8211; Posted on 09/30/2007 &#8211; Kim Parsell<br />An Eastern Tiger Swallowtail perches on some tall ironweed that grows down near the pond.

I believe that her participation in WordCamps and the docs team enriched her life; every WC she went to, there was always someone she&#8217;s known online that she would connect with and check up on. She was concerned with everyone&#8217;s well-being.</p>\n<p>She wouldn&#8217;t be a coder in our common understanding, but she understood coders. She understood the pitfalls of an isolated life and encouraged people to reach out and be concerned for one another. Her record of kindness and generosity have set an example for a lot of others to follow.</p></blockquote>\n<hr />\n<a href=\"http://www.kpimages.net/index.php?showimage=235\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2245\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/20070819053504_dscf0784.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" /></a>Misty Morning &#8211; Posted on 08/19/2007 &#8211; Kim Parsell<br />Storms the night before gave way to dense fog in early morning.

And the reciprocal of that is that I sought her approval for what I did, how I behaved and how I handled myself in the WordPress community and in life.</p>\n<p>Just to be clear, she never said or did anything that indicated that her approval was needed. Or that it was a condition for her friendship. But she was #wpmom and that’s just how it was for me. Our online interactions were fun and collaborating with her in the WordPress community was a learning experience for me. I used that experience to become better at my job and it showed.</p>\n<p>When I had to deal with a death in my family, she was one of the people I emailed. I needed that interaction and she was there for me with others in the community.</p>\n<p>I met Kim in person at WordCamp SF 2014. She was amazed at how everyone was treating her. All these people she had contact with and everyone was thrilled to meet her. When the time came, she gave a video presentation on the docs team. She was nervous, had some laptop troubles and didn’t feel prepared. She did fine and I was there cheering her on from the sidelines.</p>\n<p>After WCSF 2014 we stayed in touch and I would send her images of things my children did. When I got the news of her passing it was hard. But she left an amazing example. She taught me and others to take care of yourself, take care of those close to you and be a responsible person. How often do you meet someone like that? I’m so glad for having met her. Just by being herself she made me a better person.</p></blockquote>\n<hr />\n<a href=\"http://www.kpimages.net/index.php?showimage=109\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2249\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/20070516131722_dscf0942-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" /></a>Fire at Night, Part II &#8211; Posted on 02/17/2007 &#8211; Kim Parsell<br />7/10/2005 &#8211; The colors become more brilliant as the sky darkens even more.<br />Copyright © 2005 Kim Parsell.

She knew the things she knew, and had a pretty good idea of how to find out the things she didn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;d be amazed how far the simple quality of that &#8220;self starter&#8221; attitude can take you as a contributor.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m not intentionally diminishing Kim to simply having the will to pull herself up by her proverbial boot straps. It&#8217;s merely to demonstrate the point that Kim&#8217;s temperament and poise in unfamiliar situations was unmatched, and that is one of the reasons why she was able to affect so much positive change in WordPress.</p>\n<p>Kim&#8217;s positive attitude and helping nature was infectious. She had the uncanny ability to walk into a room of complete strangers and walk out with a group of new friends – and newly-gleaned knowledge to go along with it.</p>\n<p>When Kim visited WordCamp San Francisco (the precursor to WordCamp US) for the first time in 2014, it was hugs all around. Literally. Kim had been contributing to WordPress for years and largely never met many of the people she&#8217;d had an opportunity to collaborate with.</p>\n<p>The community summit was being held in conjunction with WCSF that year and the only way she could afford to go was on a travel scholarship offered at the time by the foundation – the same scholarship that now justly bears her name.</p>\n<p>It was an amazing thing to see, made all the more tragic when Kim left us just a few short months later. She was well on her way to realizing her goal of being able to contribute full time and get paid for her effort.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sad to say Kim never got there, but her spirit lives on in the people she knew and inspired. Here&#8217;s hoping that the Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship will serve to further inspire those who follow in her footsteps.</p></blockquote>\n<hr />\n\n<a

4.8.3 <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/10/wordpress-4-8-3-security-release/\">is available</a> and is a security release for 4.8.2 and all previous versions. This release addresses an issue with $wpdb-&gt;prepare() that could lead to a potential SQL injection. While WordPress core is not vulnerable, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardening_(computing)\">hardening</a> has been added to prevent plugins and themes from inadvertently causing a vulnerability.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re experiencing a bit of déjà vu, it&#8217;s because WordPress 4.8.2 <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/09/wordpress-4-8-2-security-and-maintenance-release/\">attempted to solve</a> the same problem. <a href=\"https://blog.ircmaxell.com/2017/10/disclosure-wordpress-wpdb-sql-injection-background.html\">According</a> to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ircmaxell\">Anthony Ferrara</a> who <a href=\"https://blog.ircmaxell.com/2017/10/disclosure-wordpress-wpdb-sql-injection-technical.html\">reported and disclosed</a> the vulnerability, the patch in 4.8.2 didn&#8217;t solve the underlying problem and broke many sites.</p>\n<p>Ferrara says he reported the issue immediately after 4.8.2 was released and was ignored by the WordPress security team for several weeks.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When I got the attention of the team, they wanted to fix a subset of the issue I reported,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It became clear to me that releasing a partial fix was worse than no fix (for many reasons). So I decided the only way to make the team realize the full extent was to Full Disclosure the issue.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Full Disclosure is the process of publicly sharing technical details of a vulnerability so that the public knows the same amount of information about it as hackers. The threat of full disclosure is typically used to pressure businesses and software creators to act swiftly and release patches as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>On October 26th, Ferrara used his Twitter account to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ircmaxell/status/923662170092638208\">notify the public</a> that WordPress contained a serious SQLi vulnerability and that because he lacked confidence in the team, fully disclosing it was his only option. His message was retweeted 562 times and liked by 484 people.</p>\n<p>The amount of publicity his Tweet received had an impact as on October 27th, Ferrara reported that constructive discussions resumed with the team and that he would delay the disclosure until October 31st.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">RE: WP Issue: I constructive discussions have resumed with the security team. I will be delaying FD until at earliest the 31st.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Anthony Ferrara (@ircmaxell) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ircmaxell/status/923907743555178496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 27, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>On October 27th, Ferrara spoke to a member of the WordPress security team who provided a fresh set of eyes to the problem, &#8220;A security team member who hadn’t yet participated in the thread went back to the beginning of the thread and re-read every post,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;He (correctly I may add) summarized the entirety of the issues, as well as asked a few clarifying questions. He also asked for a little more time but gave me a target of Tuesday, October 31st so it wasn’t wide open. This was the response I was looking for the entire time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Both parties collaborated on a patch that fixed the issue and WordPress 4.8.3 was released. Although his experience started out frustrating, Ferrara is hopeful that the team will do better with future reports.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I get that there are competing priorities,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But show attention. Show that you’ve read what’s written. And if someone tells you it seems like you don’t understand something, stop and get clarification. And ask for help. Overall, I hope the WP security team moves forward from this. I do honestly see hope.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Aaron Campbell, WordPress Security Team Lead, says that although there were some rough patches in working with Ferrara, they were able to work together to get a fix released in the end. While the threat of full disclosure didn&#8217;t have a huge impact on getting the vulnerability patched, it may have been the catalyst to get a new person involved in the process.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A threat of disclosure certainly adds pressure and possibly stress, but doesn’t actually change the overall equation that much.&#8221; Campbell said. &#8220;An issue isn’t more severe because it’s going to be disclosed, but it can become more rushed (meaning a higher likelihood of mistakes).</p>\n<p>In this case, I actually think the threat of disclosure ended up coinciding with one of the people from our security team joining in to help out. The new person was much better at communicating with Anthony, and it really turned things around.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the official release post, the WordPress Security Team thanked Ferrara for practicing <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/\">Responsible Disclosure</a>. This generated some conversation on Twitter on whether responsible disclosure should be renamed to coordinated disclosure.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Dear WordPress:</p>\n<p>Stop calling it \"responsible disclosure\". It\'s \"coordinated disclosure\".</p>\n<p>&mdash; Scott Arciszewski (@CiPHPerCoder) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CiPHPerCoder/status/925384513307504641?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 31, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m not sure I know what the terminology change would be aiming to accomplish,&#8221; Campbell said. &#8220;I do see that some places use this particular phrasing, but honestly I don’t see how it conveys anything that’s not already generally understood with responsible disclosure.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Users are encouraged to update their sites to 4.8.3 as soon as possible.

The deadline for compliance is May 28, 2018, approximately 200 days from now. The Danish duo met at WordCamp Europe a few years ago and were inspired to work together on several projects, with GDPR compliance for WordPress sites being the most urgent item on their list.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We want to create a standard for plugin creators to describe what kind of data they store and how to handle it,&#8221; Suhm said. &#8220;With a standard like this it will be possible to build tools to make WP sites compliant with GDPR. That basically means things like generating privacy policies, tools to export sensitive data, and tools to delete it completely. GDPR is pretty complex, so there will likely be a lot of tools around this. The first thing we need is a standard. It&#8217;s critical especially for EU based companies, and I can tell you that it&#8217;s something people discuss in every meetup and WordCamp over here.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The GDPR for WordPress site includes a summary of website owners&#8217; obligations in regards to collecting data related to EU citizens. It&#8217;s not comprehensive but gives an idea of what items the standard will need to cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tell the user: who you are, why you collect the data, for how long and who receives it.</li>\n<li>Get a clear consent, before collecting any data</li>\n<li>Let users access their data, and take it with them</li>\n<li>Let users delete their data</li>\n<li>Let users know if data breaches occur</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Steffensen and Suhm&#8217;s first step is <a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/U9zp6rS1HSDcKZI42\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">surveying WordPress plugin developers</a> to gauge their awareness of the GDPR. They also want to know if developers would be interested in using a free, open source solution, like a simple file with a map of personal and sensitive data stored by their plugins. The GDPR for WordPress team would then use the tool as a foundation to build tools that can take care of compliance by parsing these files.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When we have the survey data we will continue to work on the standard,&#8221; Suhm said. &#8220;It will be 100% open source, so everyone can use it to build whatever they see fit afterwards. So far it&#8217;s just a lot of ideas and we really want to collect as much input as possible so we can get everyone onboard.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The team has created a roadmap that that they will update based on feedback from plugin developers. They plan to work on the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Methodology to describe how a plugin collects, stores, and uses personal data</li>\n<li>Methodology file builder for plugin developers to use</li>\n<li>Provide a clear visual compliance indicator on every plugin installed</li>\n<li>Privacy policy text builder based on installed (compliant) plugins</li>\n<li>Provide an administrative overview on each users data being stored, across plugins</li>\n<li>Provide an administrative way to send user data to a specific user upon request</li>\n<li>Provide an administrative way to delete user data on a specific user upon request</li>\n<li>Add site wide Explicit consent checkbox, with detailed yet plain English on what data is stored, how it is used and how long. (This is a replacement for the cookie popup) – possible disablement of submitting actions until consent is given? The request to collect data should happen to every user before any data is collected, that might also mean cookies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Despite the quickly approaching deadline, solutions aimed at helping WordPress sites to be compliant with the GDPR are virtually non-existent. There are currently only <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/GDPR/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">six plugins in the directory</a> with descriptions that mention having been built with GDPR compliance and privacy in mind. Many site owners will be woefully unprepared to comply with the legislation.</p>\n<p>A couple of months ago we looked the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gravity-forms-stop-entries-plugin-aims-to-help-sites-comply-with-the-eus-gdpr\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Wider Gravity Forms Stop Entries plugin</a>, which helps site owners protect the privacy of form submissions by preventing them from being stored in the database. Since many plugins don&#8217;t have these options built in, other plugin developers have to extend them to suit their users&#8217; needs. At the moment, there is no standard way of doing this because of the wide variance in how plugins store their data.</p>\n<p>This solution the GDPR for WordPress team is proposing is different in that it aims to give plugin authors a standard for including a meta description of the personal and sensitive data that their plugins stores. The GDPR doesn&#8217;t prohibit plugins from storing personal identifiable data but it does require website owners to detail what, where, and for what purpose it is stored.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The problem right now is that it is almost impossible to figure out what information a WordPress plugin stores and where it is stored,&#8221; Suhm said. &#8220;This will make it possible to build general solutions across plugins to ensure GDPR compliance. An example could be a tool to delete sensitive data from a WordPress site, including the data stored by plugins. That is only possible if plugin authors include some sort of description of their &#8216;data footprint.\'&#8221;</p>\n<p>The biggest challenge the team has is rallying plugin developers to get on board with following a new standard and updating their plugins to provide a data footprint. This is not an easy task as the burden of compliance falls to the website owners, not individual plugin developers. Even if site owners are motivated to educate themselves, the prospect of figuring out what data is being stored and where can be daunting. If the GDPR for WordPress team can successfully get the plugin developer community on board, they can work together to build a suite of tools that help end users get a broad overview of their sites&#8217; GDPR compliance.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 30 Oct 2017 23:20:24 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"Post Status: The WordPress product market is completely different now\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=39797\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-product-market-completely-different-now/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8685:\"<p><em>This article is a member contribution from Scott Bolinger. Scott is the founder of <a href=\"https://hollerwp.com/\">Holler Box</a> and the co-founder of <a href=\"https://apppresser.com/\">AppPresser</a>.</em></p>\n<p>The WordPress economy is changing, and many businesses are feeling it.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/future-wordpress-economy-im-not-worried/\">market is maturing</a>, and <a href=\"http://chrislema.com/wordpress-economy-shrinking/\">customers are behaving differently</a>. It&#8217;s happening slowly, but I think everyone realizes things are changing.</p>\n<p>Often this change has been discussed in terms of hosts and agencies, but let&#8217;s talk about products.</p>\n<p>I just read an article on Indie Hackers about MH Themes, a premium theme shop that started in 2013. They describe a <a href=\"https://www.indiehackers.com/businesses/mh-themes\">hard-fought journey</a> to a solid $30K in monthly revenue, but they have noticed big changes in the market since they started.</p>\n<p>The author, Michael Hebenstreit, puts it this way:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Back in 2013 it was much easier to launch a WordPress theme and make it somewhat popular. Today the market for WordPress themes has become heavily crowded and oversaturated. It&#8217;s near to impossible to make a theme highly successful without investing lots of time and money in marketing and building a community behind your product.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It comes as no surprise that the theme business is saturated; it <a href=\"http://scottbolinger.com/wordpress-theme-business/\">has been for years</a>. I would now say the plugin business is saturated as well.</p>\n<p>From 2008 to 2010 you could have released just about any decent plugin or theme, and it would have done fairly well, simply because there was very little competition. The WordPress market was in an early and extreme growth phase. People were realizing there was money to be made.</p>\n<p>Many different product categories were ripe for innovation, with no dominant players at all. For example, the eCommerce landscape was wide open before WooCommerce became popular in 2011. Now there is no one even remotely close to them, and <a href=\"https://ithemes.com/exchange/\">competing</a> with WooCommerce doesn&#8217;t seem like a good idea.</p>\n<p>Today what we see in most product categories is at least one dominant player, and many other new entrants at their heels. Backups, security, SEO, themes, page builders, forms, caching, lead generation, and other categories all have stiff competition.</p>\n<p>Previously the competition was a developer trying to figure out how to grow a company. Now it&#8217;s a 30+ person organization with millions of dollars in revenue. iThemes, Yoast, Gravity Forms, Awesome Motive, and WooCommerce are just a few. These companies have a loyal following that makes it harder for smaller shops to take a piece of the pie.</p>\n<p>Popular plugins now have millions of downloads, lots of articles written about them, and avid fans. They are becoming harder and harder to dethrone, or even to challenge for a slice of market share.</p>\n<h3>Your product is a commodity</h3>\n<p>As Alex Turnbull says <a href=\"https://www.groovehq.com/blog/commoditization\">in this recent article</a>, &#8220;if your product isn&#8217;t already a commodity, it will become one in the next few years.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s becoming easier and easier to create and sell a product online. Developers are ubiquitous, websites are cheap, and many people can build something on the side with a full time job.</p>\n<p>That means when you release a product you not only have the established leaders to contend with, but lots smaller players with great products just getting started. Even if your product is great, there are 10 other great products in the same category.</p>\n<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean a great product isn&#8217;t important — it certainly is. It does mean that it&#8217;s not enough.</p>\n<p>If your product isn&#8217;t enough to stand out in a crowded marketplace, what does it take?</p>\n<h3>How to bring a new product to market now</h3>\n<p>The old way of starting a new product might have been to go where there was less competition and create a better product. If there are still places of &#8220;less competition&#8221; they are much harder to see.</p>\n<p>You can go after a niche, but WordPress is already a niche. A niche within a niche is a very small market.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not impossible to slay the giant Goliath product companies. As <a href=\"https://blog.asmartbear.com/compete-on-profit.html\">Jason Cohen</a> points out, they have an Achilles heel: &#8220;The profitable revenue stream is a prison.&#8221; They are slower to adapt to changes in the marketplace because they can still make money doing what they have always done.</p>\n<p>If you are thinking about bringing a new product to market, here are a few observations that may help you.</p>\n<h4>1) It&#8217;s going to be a lot harder than it used to be, and it&#8217;s going to take longer.</h4>\n<p>Can you go for a year (or two) without making any money and still be cranking out code and marketing yourself? That may be what it takes.</p>\n<p>Putting up a website and starting a content strategy takes six months to see any solid organic traffic. Publishing your plugin to official WordPress directory does not result in automatic downloads. The newer search algorithms favor the entrenched plugins that have more downloads and reviews.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s an uphill battle, and it takes time.</p>\n<h4>2) You must have a strategic advantage, or a unique difference to win.</h4>\n<p>Ninja Forms went into a crowded space against one of the most popular plugins of all time, Gravity Forms. They gained an advantage by offering a free version and distributing it on the directory, while Gravity Forms was entirely commercial. Why did they do so much better than other free form plugins? I don’t know, but they certainly executed well, and they have created a great brand.</p>\n<p>Can you find a competitive advantage and exploit it?</p>\n<p>One weakness I see in many WordPress companies is marketing. Many of the early successes in WordPress were coders who made a cool plugin. Most of them are not marketers, and they have enough business without needing to learn marketing. This leaves the door open for companies with great marketing.</p>\n<p>Can you dominate an under-marketed product category?</p>\n<p>You are going to have to do something different and better than what has come before. Copying a business model that worked in 2012 is not a good strategy.</p>\n<h4>3) Branding is more important than ever.</h4>\n<p>Your brand is what will help you gain market share against your competitors.</p>\n<p>A brand is not your logo, and it’s not what you say about your company. It’s what they say. They, as in, your customers.</p>\n<p>Providing great customer service, getting to know people at events, being helpful on social media, providing refunds without asking questions — these are all parts of your brand. Being known for doing good work is another, so that when you release a new product, people just buy it.</p>\n<p>I think of the brand Pippin Williamson has built for himself, since he is known for putting out high quality products. I will buy a plugin he makes over a more established competitor because of his reputation for quality. iThemes is another great example of a company that cares about their customers. They have built a brand on integrity.</p>\n<p>Building a brand takes time, but it is more important than ever.</p>\n<h3>Looking forward</h3>\n<p>The WordPress market is no longer high growth and low competition.</p>\n<p>The companies involved in products are maturing into well staffed, well funded operations. Their fans are loyal, and their products are entrenched. This makes it harder for new entrants into the market to compete.</p>\n<p>New products must have a well thought out strategy to gain traction in this competitive marketplace. Without unique positioning and hard fought execution, they will not survive.</p>\n<p>It’s not all bad news, because this is how most marketplaces look already. It’s a sign that those of us who make products need to get more creative about how we approach product development and marketing.</p>\n<p>As the more successful companies get larger, they will also become more resistant to change. When this happens, newer product offerings will be able to steal market share with fast paced innovation and development.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This post was originally posted for <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/club\">Post Status Club Members</a>.

DeVore is aiming to make WP Dispensary a complete online menu software solution for dispensaries and delivery services. The business has grown enough over recent months for him to begin working full-time on it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the larger objectives going full time with WP Dispensary was to put together content that was specific for both dispensary owners and freelance WordPress developers,&#8221; Devore said. &#8220;There is a 50/50 split with buyers, so I know that writing content to outline how WPD can help you specifically is an important next step.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Due to recent demand seen in pre-sales questions, DeVore has just released a Dispensary Details plugin to meet the needs of the much larger market of customers using WooCommerce. The plugin does not require WP Dispensary to work.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Instead of leaving a need out there, I looked at WP Dispensary and knew I could create a standalone plugin that added the proper details and displayed cleanly within the WooCommerce structure,&#8221; DeVore said.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.wpdispensary.com/downloads/dispensary-details-for-woocommerce/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dispensary Details for WooCommerce</a> plugin is the first of its kind for the e-commerce platform. It adds custom taxonomies and metaboxes that allow store owners to add cannabis details to products, including information like compound details, aromas, effects, conditions, vendors, symptoms, and more.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dispensary-details-front-end-table.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin includes separate Edibles and Topicals details boxes where store owners can enter THC/CBD per serving, size, serving count, and net weight. It also has a Grower Details box for cannabis shops that sell clones or seeds with specific sections for origin, average grow time and yield, and the clones/seeds per unit.</p>\n<p>Dispensary Details for WooCommerce works with any WordPress theme and simply adds the new Details tab to product pages alongside the various other tabs that WooCommerce displays. The plugin is priced at $149.00, which includes one year of support and updates.</p>\n<p>The WordPress product market is just starting to build solutions for the growing marijuana industry, and DeVore predicts that WordPress site builders will soon be in high demand.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I feel like the industry is going to become more regulated and also increased banking will allow for companies to focus on the marketing/sales side of the business rather than the business side of the business. With companies like KIND Financial recently putting out a <a href=\"http://kind.financial/kind-seed-payment/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">seed-to-sale solution</a> along with a bank in Canada, it&#8217;s just a sign that things are changing for the better.&#8221;</p>\n<p>DeVore said changes like these will allow businesses to focus on their websites and WordPress developers will have the opportunity to provide solutions for them, just like they already do for so many other industries. Outside of the U.S. there are already many mail order cannabis services in operation and DeVore said inside the U.S. he has noticed a lot of delivery services that are using WP Dispensary with WooCommerce to allow patients to place orders.</p>\n<p>More competition is starting to sprout up for this new niche in the WordPress ecosystem and many of them are working towards providing more comprehensive e-commerce solutions. <a href=\"https://liftedthemes.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lifted Themes</a> is a shop that sells WordPress plugins and themes for the marijuana industry. The company is working on building products that will sync with major POS or Seed to Sale systems. Similarly, <a href=\"https://h32b.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">H32B</a> provides a theme along with a suite of WooCommerce plugins for medical marijuana dispensaries.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-27-at-3.12.08-PM-e1509135316697.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mmjecommerce.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MMJ E-Commerce</a> is another newer company that provides WooCommerce and WordPress plugins and services for dispensaries with a focus on resources for compliance.

One of the annual traditions that&#8217;s part of the event is the <a href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/wordpress-2017-survey\">WordPress User Survey</a>.

When asked why, Matt Mullenweg replied, &#8220;Lots of data to go over, but basically more people are using WordPress, app development is growing, lots of people are making their living with WordPress, and other great trends are showing up,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We’ll try to do a blog post about it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That blog post was never published. Additionally, results from last year&#8217;s survey were not shared during the State of the Word or in a blog post.</p>\n<p>Thousands of people take the survey providing insight into trends, how people use the software, and demographics. If users voluntarily provide this data to WordPress.org, sharing the results with the public whether it&#8217;s a blog post, separate session, or during the State of the Word, would be a nice way to return the favor.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 27 Oct 2017 20:04:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"WPTavern: Patreon Launches App Directory and Free WordPress Plugin for Membership Sites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=76094\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:98:\"https://wptavern.com/patreon-launches-app-directory-and-free-wordpress-plugin-for-membership-sites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3319:\"<p><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Patreon</a> was founded in May 2013 as a service with business tools that allow content creators to crowdfund their work through donations and subscriptions.

The upcoming 4.9 release builds on this progress and will introduce some long-awaited improvements to Text widget. Users will finally be able to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/10/24/widget-improvements-in-wordpress-4-9/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">use shortcodes in the Text widget</a> without the help of additional code from plugins or themes.</p>\n<p>This new feature is the answer to an eight-year-old <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10457\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ticket</a> requesting shortcode support inside the Text widget. Weston Ruter broke down the technical details in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/10/24/widget-improvements-in-wordpress-4-9/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dev note</a> for the feature, explaining why it took so long to find a solution:</p>\n<blockquote><p>One reason for the long delay with adding shortcode support in Text widgets was due to many shortcodes looking for a global <code>$post</code> when they run. Since the global <code>$post</code> varies depending on whatever the query is, the shortcodes in a Text widget could render wildly different on different templates of a site. The solution worked out was to temporarily nullify the global <code>$post</code> before doing the shortcodes so that they will consistently have the same global state, with this global $post then restored after the shortcodes are done.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hundreds of thousands of WordPress installations currently <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/shortcodes+text+widget/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">use a plugin to add shortcode support to widgets</a>. Contributors to 4.9 have taken this into account so that updating will not cause unexpected issues.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If a plugin has added <code>do_shortcode()</code> to <code>widget_text</code> then this filter will be suspended while the widget runs to prevent shortcodes from being applied twice,&#8221; Ruter said.</p>\n<p>In addition to the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-core-gallery-widget-targeted-for-wordpress-4-9\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">new core gallery widget</a> landing in 4.9, this release will also allow users to embed media in the Text widget. A new &#8220;Add Media&#8221; button is available, making it easy for users to insert images, audio, galleries, and videos, along with text and other content. WordPress 4.9 also adds support for oEmbeds in the Text widget and the Video widget has been updated with expanded support for any oEmbed provider for video.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-26-at-12.00.59-AM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Little enhancements like these make it easier for users to update their own websites without having to hire a developer or add extra plugins for things that should be simple. The improvements to widgets have also been implemented in such a way that users will be more prepared for how Gutenberg will handle media.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The media-specific widgets are closely aligned with blocks in Gutenberg; the existence of media inside the Text widget will align with eventual nested blocks in Gutenberg, and would be treated as Classic Text blocks in any future migration from widgets to blocks,&#8221; Ruter said.</p>\n<p>WordPress 4.9 will improve the experience of switching between themes by including logic that is better at mapping widgets between two themes&#8217; widget areas. This release will also improve the <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/23120\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">UI for updating and saving widgets</a> in the admin screen. It adds an indicator that shows whether or not widget changes have been saved, as well as a notice if the user attempts to leave the page with unsaved changes.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 26 Oct 2017 05:46:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 292 – Recap of WooConf and CaboPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=76080&preview=true&preview_id=76080\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-292-recap-of-wooconf-and-cabopress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2434:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"https://jjj.blog/\">John James Jacoby</a> and I are joined by Cody Landefeld, co-founder of <a href=\"https://modeeffect.com/\">Mode Effect</a>. Landefeld described his experience attending WooConf as we reviewed highlights from the State of the Woo.</p>\n<p>We also discussed WooCommerce retiring its Canvas theme in favor of Storefront.

Now each browser has mature developer tools. That’s because of Firebug. Mission accomplished!&#8221;</p>\n<p>In recognition of what Firebug brought to developers, Mozilla reviewed one of the most important points in Firebug history &#8211; the decision to open source the software. This allowed for the proliferation of similar browser development tools that we see today. Firebug creator Joe Hewitt, who eventually moved on to Facebook, made the tool open source in December 2006:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The first announcement is in regards to Firebug’s licensing. As I was developing Firebug 1.0, I began to wonder if I should try to turn the project from a hobby into a business. When I proposed this idea on my blog, the response was very positive and reaffirmed my belief that Firebug could do well as a commercial product.<br />\nHowever, in the end, I just don’t feel like that is the right thing to do. I love working on Firebug because I know I’m making a lot of people happy and helping to advance the state of the art. That’s a lot more meaningful to me than just about anything else, and so, I’ve decided that <strong>Firebug will remain free and open source.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Mozilla reported that more than a million people are still using the Firebug add-on. Firefox Developer Tools has a guide for <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Migrating_from_Firebug\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">migrating from Firebug</a>. There are still several Firebug features missing from Firefox DevTools, but <a href=\"https://bugzil.la/991806\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mozilla is tracking them</a> and working to bring greater parity between the two. Support for the separate Firebug extension will be discontinued with the release of Firefox Quantum (version 57) in November 2017.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 25 Oct 2017 19:26:53 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"WPTavern: WordPress 4.9 Beta 4 Removes ‘Try Gutenberg’ Call to Action\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=76047\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-9-beta-4-removes-try-gutenberg-call-to-action\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5619:\"<p>WordPress beta releases typically don&#8217;t generate controversy but in WordPress 4.9 Beta 3, a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41316\">call to action was added</a> to the dashboard that encouraged users to install and activate <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\">Gutenberg</a>.</p>\n<img />Try Gutenberg Call to Action\n<p>Members of the WordPress community raised concerns that clients may install Gutenberg and shared ways to hide the prompt from users.

Before core encourages millions of sites to use the plugin and rely on it functioning a certain way.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Other members of the community advocated for the call to action saying it would lead to a larger test sample.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Getting the public to test Gutenberg is essential.

However, to the best of my knowledge, there has never been a dashboard prompt encouraging users to install and activate a beta plugin on a live site.</p>\n<p>Although the call to action is focused on raising awareness of Gutenberg, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41316#comment:47\">John James Jacoby suggests</a> that the meta block be rewritten so that it can be recycled for other features or plugins to use in the future.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My concern is that the current approach is not scalable to future feature developments beyond Gutenberg,&#8221; Jacoby said. &#8220;For example, when a new codenamed feature comes along for WordPress 5.2, cloning this same approach does not seem ideal.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He suggests that the dashboard widget become a standard part of the dashboard. &#8220;This way, we can hype the new hotness on an as-needed basis, and plugins that want to hide it forever can reliably do so one time in a plugin,&#8221; Jacoby said.</p>\n<h2>When Is the Right Time to Hype Gutenberg to the Masses?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\">Gutenberg</a> is actively installed on more than 3K sites with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/advanced/\">nearly half of installations</a> running version 1.4. This is a far cry from the 100K active installs <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-new-gutenberg-editor-now-available-as-a-plugin-for-testing\">Mullenweg would like to see</a> before merging it into core.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think advertising Gutenberg in the dashboard to millions of users as the new editing experience should be considered until a merge proposal has been published on the Make Core WordPress site. By this time, many of its quirks and how it handles meta data, meta blocks, and preventing data loss will likely be solved.</p>\n<p>I am one of the people who raised their eyebrows at the idea of advertising Gutenberg at its current stage of development to the masses. My primary concern is that it&#8217;s not ready yet. At the same time, I wonder when or if there is a right or responsible time to advertise installing beta software onto a live site.

When a page is cached almost all of WordPress is skipped and the page is sent to the browser with the minimum amount of code executed. This makes the page load much faster.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately if you want to run code on every page load you&#8217;re out of luck as regular WordPress plugins are not loaded or executed. You&#8217;ll need to write a WP Super Cache plugin. This short introduction will not teach you how to write plugins but the example plugins that ship with WP Super Cache will get you a long way towards understanding how they work.</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>WP Super Cache ships with some example plugins in wp-super-cache/plugins/. Some of them even do useful tasks like help with domain mapping and Jetpack integration. There&#8217;s one called &#8220;awaitingmoderation.php&#8221; which removes the text &#8220;Your comment is awaiting moderation.&#8221; when someone writes a moderated comment.<br />\nThere&#8217;s also dynamic-cache-test.php which is a complicated beast but it&#8217;s heavily commented. It allows you to add template tags to your site that are replaced when the cached page is loaded.</p>\n<p>Before you get started writing a plugin you should be aware that you should <em>not</em> use the wp-super-cache/plugins/ directory. Every time WP Super Cache is updated this directory is deleted. So, edit your wp-config.php and set <code>$wp_cache_plugins_dir</code> to another directory where you&#8217;ll put your plugin.</p>\n<p>These plugins run before most of WordPress has loaded. That means you can&#8217;t rely on some of the nice features of WordPress such as filters and actions. However, WP Super Cache has it&#8217;s own action/filter system that is similar to actions and filters in WordPress:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>add_cacheaction( $action, $func )</li>\n<li>do_cacheaction( $action, $value = &#8221; )</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A cacheaction is also a filter. If you hook on to a cache action that has a parameter, you must return that parameter at the end of the function like you would with a WordPress filter.</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>If you need to hook into a WordPress filter use the imaginatively named cache action &#8220;add_cacheaction&#8221;. That runs on &#8220;init&#8221; so the function that is executed can use <code>add_action()</code> or <code>add_filter()</code>. You can see this in action in the plugins/dynamic-cache-test.php or plugins/awaitingmoderation.php scripts.</p>\n<p>Two very useful filters are the WordPress filter, &#8220;wpsupercache_buffer&#8221; (in wp-cache-phase2.php) that is used to modify the page before it is <em>cached</em> and the cache action &#8220;wpsc_cachedata&#8221; (in wp-cache-phase1.php) is used to modify the cached page just before it&#8217;s <em>served</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Related Posts</strong><ul><li> <a href=\"https://odd.blog/2008/10/24/wp-super-cache-084-the-garbage-collector/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: WP Super Cache 0.8.4, the garbage collector\">WP Super Cache 0.8.4, the garbage collector</a></li><li> <a href=\"https://odd.blog/2010/02/08/wp-super-cache-099/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: WP Super Cache 0.9.9\">WP Super Cache 0.9.9</a></li><li> <a href=\"https://odd.blog/2009/07/17/wp-super-cache-0-9-5/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: WP Super Cache 0.9.5\">WP Super Cache 0.9.5</a></li></ul></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://odd.blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 25 Oct 2017 16:21:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Donncha\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"HeroPress: Paying It Forward\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2217\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:108:\"https://heropress.com/essays/paying-it-forward/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=paying-it-forward\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8261:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102817-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull quote: The spirit of WordPress is paying it forward.\" /><p>I have always embraced an entrepreneurial spirit. As a kid in the 1970’s, I tagged along with my parents to craft shows on the weekends where they made and sold hand-stamped leather belts to earn extra income and I made macrame necklaces and sold those too. When I was 14 I told my dad I wanted to be a stewardess when I grew up, he said “Why not be the pilot? Be the captain!” and gave me some flight lessons for my birthday (I discovered I get air sick very easily, so did not pursue that dream for long!).</p>\n<p>Throughout my childhood and into adulthood, I loved to create things that people would buy from me &#8211; from a lemonade stand when I was 7 to custom-made t-shirts I sold on football weekends in college;</p>\n<blockquote><p>I was always thinking about ways to earn income &#8211; not to get rich, but to have the validation that I created something of value to others.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Pivoting to Entrepreneurship</h3>\n<p>Fast-forward to a time after my first child was born. My career in advertising and marketing introduced me to tools, techniques and jargon that are still valid today, but “working for the man” was never a truly satisfying experience for me. Thankfully, my husband had a salaried job with benefits, and since he traveled a lot for work, we decided that I would stay home with our son. When I left my marketing job, my boss suggested I start a little business selling illustrated prints I had become known for around the office, having given them as gifts to my co-workers when they had babies.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2219\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/growupgirl.gif\" alt=\"Cartoon people holding up letters that spell MORGAN\" width=\"249\" height=\"153\" />With that idea in mind, I started gradually spreading the word among my new “mom” friends, and before I knew it, about 5 years later, with a second child and a wonderful network of moms, I had a full-fledged stationery business, TLC by TARA, that allowed me to work from home and take care of my kids. My income was low, but grew over the years until it covered piano lessons for my children and a car payment on an awesome blue Dodge mini van!</p>\n<blockquote><p>More importantly, this “accidental” career allowed me to broaden my identity and skill set without even intending to.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It introduced me to wonderful friends and fellow entrepreneurs, and satisfied that craving for validation, connection, and a little bit of income.</p>\n<h3>Pivoting to the Web</h3>\n<p>The business began before the internet was “a thing” and before computers were widely used. By 2003, however, I began to explore digital tools and built a website for my business using Microsoft Front Page. I uploaded hundreds of illustrations and laid them out in html tables.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/screenshot_2017-10-10_12.21.58_1024.png\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-2218\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/screenshot_2017-10-10_12.21.58_1024.png\" alt=\"Example of design library by Tara Claeys\" width=\"350\" height=\"360\" /></a>I fell in love with technology and eventually decided to stop making stationery. I got rid of my industrial printer, paper cutter, paper, and supplies and changed my business name to Design TLC to focus on graphic and web design. I had heard about WordPress and volunteered to build a new website for my neighborhood association and a local women’s cycling group to check out the platform, practice and learn. I taught myself how to make custom child themes and combined that with my marketing background to create websites for a number of small local businesses.</p>\n<h3>And then WordCamp</h3>\n<p>It wasn’t until 2014 that I discovered the WordPress community. I heard about “WordCamps” and found one near me, in Baltimore, Maryland. By chance I sat at a lunch table with two strangers who I later learned were quite well known in the WordPress world &#8211; Chris Lema and Shay Bocks. They were so friendly and supportive, answering my many questions and offering tips and advice that changed my approach to website design and to running my business. I still think back to that experience as transformative; having lived in a bubble for the first years of working with WordPress, it was eye-opening to discover its community and resources.</p>\n<p>I quickly started absorbing everything I could about WordPress. I live-streamed WordCamp San Francisco in 2014, and joined Slack and Facebook groups. I started listening to a ton of WordPress podcasts and attended WordCamp Philadelphia and WordCamp New York City. I began attending the DC WordPress Meetup, where eventually one of the organizers encouraged me to speak about Genesis for a lightning talk. I couldn’t believe I was suddenly in a position of authority &#8211; sharing my knowledge with others when I felt like everything was still so new to me.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Like many in our community, I am plagued by imposter syndrome.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Relative to many, I am still new to WordPress and I am not a trained coder/programmer. I am also self-consciously older than many people I meet, and still sometimes think of myself as a “Mompreneur.” I am constantly making choices about what to learn next and where to focus my time and resources. Most importantly, I think about how I can run a business while also giving back to the community that has welcomed me and given me so much. I love the mission of HeroPress &#8211; giving a voice to others like me, who may often <em>feel</em> insignificant but whose lives have been inspired and enhanced by the WordPress community.  With this vision in mind, this year Liam Dempsey and I started the podcast Hallway Chats, where we introduce and talk to people who use WordPress. Like HeroPress, we hope these stories inspire someone else who in turn will keep the cycle of sharing and encouragement going!</p>\n<blockquote><p>The spirit of WordPress is “paying it forward” and I think that is the best kind of payment there is.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Paying It Forward\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Paying%20It%20Forward&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fpaying-it-forward%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Paying It Forward\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fpaying-it-forward%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fpaying-it-forward%2F&title=Paying+It+Forward\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Paying It Forward\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/paying-it-forward/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102817-150x150.jpg&description=Paying It Forward\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Paying It Forward\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/paying-it-forward/\" title=\"Paying It Forward\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/paying-it-forward/\">Paying It Forward</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 25 Oct 2017 12:00:23 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Tara Claeys\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"Dev Blog: WordPress 4.9 Beta 4\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4962\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/10/wordpress-4-9-beta-4/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2297:\"<p>WordPress 4.9 Beta 4 is now available!</p>\n<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site.

Canvas was one of the most innovative themes on the market when it first launched in 2010, giving customers the ability to modify their sites&#8217; design and layout through an extensive options panel. It sold for $99 before the <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/products/canvas/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">product URL</a> was redirected to a retirement page today.</p>\n<p>Canvas&#8217; retirement is a strong signal that Automattic is going all-in on Gutenberg. Without a complete overhaul, the theme is no longer able to keep pace with the changes that Gutenberg and the Customizer will bring to WordPress theming and site building.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While still early, we believe strongly that Gutenberg is the future,&#8221; Canvas lead developer Jeffrey Pearce said. &#8220;We’ve decided to invest our resources in preparing our products for it in order to bring you the best experience. Unfortunately, that won’t include Canvas.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WooCommerce has discontinued Canvas sales and will not be open sourcing the theme to the community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Overhauling the theme wouldn’t serve our users, yet continuing to sell it as-is wasn’t the right decision. So we made the difficult decision to say goodbye,&#8221; Pearce said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We considered open sourcing Canvas to the community, but ultimately decided that extending its lifetime will not serve the community. It’s in the best interest of our users and the community to eventually move to another theme.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WooCommerce plans to continue supporting active subscriptions and will offer support for lifetime subscriptions for the next year. However, the theme will not be updated to support newer features coming to WordPress. The team strongly urges users to migrate their sites to <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/storefront/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Storefront</a>, the company&#8217;s more mobile-friendly flagship theme built on top of the Underscores starter theme. WooCommerce has published a <a href=\"https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/choose-change-theme/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">migration guide</a> to help customers <a href=\"https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/moving-on-from-canvas/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">move on from Canvas</a>.</p>\n<p>Over the years customers have created many different types of websites (not limited to e-commerce) using Canvas. While some have accepted the inevitable, others are anxious and upset about the change, faced with the prospect of migrating dozens of sites (in many instances) away from the theme. The news of Canvas&#8217; retirement was especially difficult for those who support clients who may not be happy to pay for their existing sites to get updated with no appreciable difference. It&#8217;s not easy to sell the change to clients when most of it happens under the hood.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This puts me in a terrible position,&#8221; WooCommerce customer Leon Wagner said. &#8220;I have 10 client sites on Canvas. They look beautiful and the clients are happy. So these are done deals, I’ve been paid, and do occasional maintenance. Now you’re telling me I have to go back to each of them and explain that because you’re discontinuing this theme, my clients will now have to pay me thousands of dollars to port their sites (with no obvious improvements) to new themes. Pretty sure I’ll just lose most of those clients.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Other freelancers and small business owners find themselves in the same boat, many of them with twice that many clients on the Canvas theme. Although the theme can continue to be used without breaking, it will no longer receive compatibility or security updates after the support window expires in October 2018.

The team has also included a way for users to create posts with the Classic Editor, but this requires knowing where to go to access the dropdown (All Posts &raquo; Add New).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-24-at-11.12.41-AM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Version 1.5 <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2804\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">adds initial support for meta boxes</a> in an Extended Settings panel beneath the post content. Users won&#8217;t see this bottom panel unless they have a plugin installed that includes meta boxes. The sidebar Settings panel must already be toggled open for the bottom panel to appear.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-24-at-1.04.55-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The Extended Settings panel slides up to reveal accordion toggles for plugins that have meta box settings available. The design could use some improvement, especially for navigating back to the post editor. The panel takes over the entire section. On installations with lots of legacy meta boxes it is easy to get lost in all the open/closed toggles.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-24-at-1.19.36-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Gutenberg design lead Tammie Lister said this is the first step towards supporting meta boxes and that there will be iterations to follow. She also warned that it is possible some advanced meta box uses will not work as expected. The Gutenberg team is eager to receive feedback on these cases and will work to find solutions for them. Testers who discover issues with meta box support can <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/new\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">post an issue on GitHub</a> or via the plugin&#8217;s feedback form, describing the setup and how to reproduce what is breaking.</p>\n<p>Version 1.5 also adds <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/3008\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a new inserter button between blocks</a>, which Gutenberg engineer Matias Ventura demonstrated with an animated gif in the release post:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gutenberg-insert-between.gif?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This release <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2887\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">adds a dropdown to the Publish button</a>. It currently supports visibility and post scheduling features.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-24-at-2.25.58-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>There was a great deal of discussion on GitHub surrounding the UI for the publish button, whether it should be a split button dropdown or a single button that provides slightly more friction to prevent accidental publishing. The general consensus was that introducing a bit more friction is desirable, as contributor Davide Casali noted there are many cascading actions that are often tied to the Publish button:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Some automated publishing actions are irreversible: pings gets sent, emails get sent, Facebook and Twitter gets updates, etc.,&#8221; Casali said. &#8220;This is very very important for a lot of people and businesses, and nobody wants to send out such actions by accident.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Contributors are looking for feedback on this implementation and are willing to explore some alternate design options as well. They agreed that it is more important to make the Publish button area pluggable and to work on adapting it based on feedback.</p>\n<p>For those who want to completely disable Gutenberg, a new plugin called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Classic Editor</a> is available on WordPress.org and ready for testing. It requires WordPress 4.9-beta2 or newer and Gutenberg version 1.5+. Classic Editor comes with two modes that give users the option to fully replace Gutenberg or allow access to both the old and new editors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fully replaces the Gutenberg editor and restores the Edit Post template.</li>\n<li>Adds alternate “Edit” links to the Posts and Pages screens, on the toolbar at the top of the screen, and in the admin menu. Using these links will open the corresponding post or page in the Classic Editor.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A setting for switching between the modes is available at Settings &raquo; Writing. Other plugins for turning Gutenberg off will likely pop up the closer the it gets to being included in core, but Classic Editor is the official one recommended by core contributors.</p>\n<p>The timeline for the merge proposal is not yet set in stone but the Gutenberg team aims to get it more widely tested before writing the proposal. The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">plugin</a> is currently active on approximately 3,000 WordPress sites.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The plan is to still have the plugin ready by December, but with holidays the actual merge proposal might be next year,&#8221; Tammie Lister said. &#8220;It’s important that we get as many users and as much feedback as possible at this point. All of that impacts what happens going forward.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 24 Oct 2017 20:51:26 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"WPTavern: Facebook is Testing a “Pay to Play” Requirement for Publishers in the News Feed\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=75950\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:98:\"https://wptavern.com/facebook-is-testing-a-pay-to-play-requirement-for-publishers-in-the-news-feed\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3179:\"<p>Last week Facebook began rolling out its new <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/explore\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Explore feed</a>, which is now available for users globally on both desktop and mobile. The new Explore feed encourages discovery by including posts from people and pages that the user doesn&#8217;t follow.</p>\n<p>Over the weekend, Filip Struhárik, a journalist and editor at <a href=\"https://dennikn.sk/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Denník N</a>, published data from sixty of the largest Slovak media pages that have experienced a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@filip_struharik/biggest-drop-in-organic-reach-weve-ever-seen-b2239323413\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dramatic decrease in organic reach</a> as the result of Facebook moving Pages from the News feed into the Explore feed. Facebook representatives said this is a regional test the company is conducting in six smaller markets, including Bolivia, Cambodia, Guatemala, Serbia, Slovakia, and Sri Lanka. The main News feed in these areas includes only posts from friends and sponsors.</p>\n<p>Struhárik shared a chart that shows Slovak media pages having received 4x fewer interactions (likes, comments, shares) since the test began:</p>\n<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/slovak-media-pages.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>Interactions on 60 of the largest Slovak media Facebook pages &#8211; Source: CrowdTangle\n<p>Adam Mosseri, head of News Feed at Facebook, has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/922521929277497346\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">confirmed</a> that the experiment is limited to the six countries and the company does not plan to take roll it out globally.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not global and there are no plans to be,&#8221; Mosseri said. &#8220;People often tell us they want more from friends so we&#8217;re testing two feeds, one for friend content and another dedicated to page content.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When asked how long the experiment will last, Mosseri said, &#8220;Likely months as it can take that long for people to adapt, but we&#8217;ll be looking to improve the experience in the meantime.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the test has had a dramatic impact on traffic to publishers in the six markets where it is currently active. It has also given the rest of the world a preview of what a new &#8220;pay to play&#8221; requirement for Facebook&#8217;s main News feed might look like in the future.</p>\n<p>Limiting the main News feed to posts from friends and family and relocating content from Pages to the Explore feed would be a welcome change for users but bad news for publishers that depend on Facebook to drive referrals. The News Feed has increasingly become a never-ending pile of clickbait posts and ads that users have to sift through in order to see any meaningful content from friends.</p>\n<p>Pages and publishers have had to become highly active in marketing their content to compete with advertising. If Facebook&#8217;s split feed experiments turn out to be a success, publishers may need to allocate more resources to their advertising budgets if they want to maintain the same reach on the social network.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 23 Oct 2017 22:33:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"WPTavern: Postman SMTP Plugin Forked after Removal from WordPress.org for Security Issues\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=75870\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"https://wptavern.com/postman-smtp-plugin-forked-after-removal-from-wordpress-org-for-security-issues\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3997:\"<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/post.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/photo/MSJNQ4EHZ2\">Jerry Kiesewetter</a>\n<p>In early October the popular <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/postman-smtp/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Postman SMTP</a> plugin was removed from WordPress.org due to security issues. The plugin had not been updated in two years and also contained <a href=\"https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2017/06/29/reflected-cross-site-scripting-xss-vulnerability-in-postman-smtp/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability</a> that was made public in June and left unfixed. The security researcher&#8217;s attempts to contact the plugin&#8217;s author, Jason Hendriks, were unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>The plugin is used to improve the delivery of emails that WordPress generates and it logs the causes of failed emails to help eliminate configuration mistakes. It was installed on more than 100,000 sites before it was removed from WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>Yehuda Hassine, a WordPress developer and longtime user of the plugin, decided to fork it for the sake of its users and because he thought it was a shame to see all the the original author&#8217;s hard work go to waste.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As a fan of the amazing work Jason has done, I was amazed no one thought of taking it over,&#8221; Hassine said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a great plugin &#8211; Jason solved so many problems dealing with SMTP setup in WordPress. He worked so hard and the idea it might disappear shocked me. The plugin worked with almost zero bugs for the past two years.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Hassine&#8217;s fork <a href=\"https://github.com/yehudah/Postman-SMTP\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">started on GitHub</a> with fixes for the security issue, but he said he realized not having it on WordPress.org might be a problem for some users. He submitted it under a new name, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-smtp/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Post SMTP Mailer/Email Log</a>, and included a patch for the security vulnerability along with fixes for a few bugs with the Gmail API, Mandrill, and SendGrid. The next item on his roadmap is to fix a few issues with PHP 7 compatibility.</p>\n<p>Hassine also requested to adopt the original plugin, as there is no way to contact the 100,000 users who depend on it. He said the WordPress.org plugin team denied his request at this time due to the number of users and his relative unfamiliarity in the community, as well as to give the original author more time to respond.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-smtp\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Post SMTP Mailer/Email Log</a> fork has been alive for a week and already has more than 1,000 users. Hassine said he is spending his free time getting to know the SMTP protocol and Hendriks&#8217; original code. Postman SMTP users who want to switch to the fork can keep the same settings by simply deactivating the old plugin and activating the new one.</p>\n<p>Hassine has committed to keeping the plugin free, as many of its users are somewhat technical and able to offer each other support. He said if the fork becomes popular and more difficult to maintain, he will consider a commercial model for support.</p>\n<p>Users of the original Postman SMTP plugin had no way of learning about the reasons behind its disappearance except on third-party sites like the Wordfence blog or Facebook posts. The WordPress.org Meta team is currently working on <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2627\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">developing a better way to communicate</a> why certain plugins have been closed or removed from the directory.

It will be the first time a Camp Press event will be held in Europe.</p>\n<p>The Camp Press organization was founded to help attendees detox from digital life while spending time in nature and connecting with others in similar industries. It just wrapped up its first successful event in Oklahoma last month and the next planned event will be held in <a href=\"https://camp.press/event/camp-press-lonestar-2018/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Austin, Texas on the San Marcos River</a>, February 23-25, 2018. In a guest <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/camp-press-a-detox-from-digital-life\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> on the Tavern, Brad Williams, an attendee at the inaugural event, described how the unstructured, unplugged time led to deeper connections:</p>\n<blockquote><p>As we learned more about each other, we quickly became more comfortable as a group. We shared stories, laughed, cooked, and debated topics from tech to TV shows. We discussed very personal struggles and experiences, some of which I would guess haven’t been shared outside of close family. We sang songs around the campfire, performed late-night improv, made s’mores, and enjoyed each other’s company.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://camp.press/event/camp-press-adventure-series/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Camp Press Iceland</a> will include four days off-the-grid with the opportunity for hikes, campfires, swimming in a geothermal swimming hole, and tours of the area with minimal scheduling. Camp Press co-organizer Mendel Kurland said they chose the venue in Iceland because many people have the location on their bucket lists.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Helping geeks detox from technology and their job is important for mental health and their ability to get things done on a daily basis,&#8221; Kurland said. &#8220;Many of us also don&#8217;t want to completely let go of talking about tech, business, or what we&#8217;re working on. This gives people a chance to disconnect with other people who understand them, while marking an item off their bucket list.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Camp Press events are different from WordCamps in that they are for-profit events. In addition to ticket sales, the organization also accepts sponsorships on a per-event and annual basis. Pantheon, Dreamhost, and WPEngine joined as founding sponsors for the first event. Kurland said currently no money leaves the coffers to pay for the organizers&#8217; time and all money earned is re-invested back into the concept for hosting future events.</p>\n<p>Camp Press is also different in that it is a completely independent organization. Kurland and his co-organizers borrowed from both the WordCamp and Burning Man codes of conduct to create a <a href=\"https://camp.press/code-of-conduct/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">code for Camp Press</a> that minimizes commercial interests and emphasizes inclusion, self-expression, and civic responsibility.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve learned a lot from other organizers of WordCamps across the world &#8211; the struggles, the excitement, the fulfillment they enjoy,&#8221; Kurland said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t consider the WordCamp model or foundation for this project. Independence from community politics is essential for this type of event. It&#8217;s important to have a separate objective space for connection and something that bridges between multiple communities as opposed to connected to one.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Kurland said this type of event excels in bringing together people from different professional backgrounds and ecosystems to collaborate.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Half are WordPress people, half aren&#8217;t,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So the opportunity to cross-pollinate and bring back awesome insights that are broader than your bubble is huge. There are a few ways this event bucks the trend. Right now we&#8217;re 60% female and 40% male for registration on the Iceland event.&#8221; The previous event hosted attendees from various professions, including graphic artists, authors, developers, and product company owners.</p>\n<p>Kurland said the Camp Press organization plans to offer a few more domestic US event this year, along with one or two European events. They are also planning on running trips to other exotic destinations in the future. Based on the demand the organizers have seen, they anticipate a lot of interest in future events and are considering hosting interest-focused camps.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Camp Press events will always be accessible to most and have enough activities to accommodate many interests,&#8221; Kurland said. &#8220;The next step will probably be helping companies to build out awesome experiences to gain deep insights regarding their team or client dynamics with this same type of event. We have also considered building experiences around other communities, i.e. doctors, scientists, teachers &#8211; people who need a break and have high stress jobs, but find it hard to disconnect.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite not being paid for his efforts in organizing the Camp Press events, Kurland said he finds a lot of personal fulfillment in participating that keeps him wanting to organize more in the future.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I need disconnection as much as the participants,&#8221; Kurland said. &#8220;So, for me, I get excited thinking about disconnecting and helping others shed their phone and laptop for a few days. It&#8217;s what has driven me to create these events, and I don&#8217;t see that drive dulling anytime soon.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 20 Oct 2017 22:14:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"HeroPress: Accepting Donations\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://heropress.com/?p=2179\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:105:\"https://heropress.com/accepting-donations/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=accepting-donations\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3631:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"560\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/icons_logo_overlay-1024x597.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"HeroPress Logo laid over icons of contributors\" /><p>Over the years people have occasionally said, “You should have a donation form; I’d like to help support HeroPress”. Recently a particularly deep conversation convinced me that allowing people to take part financially is a different, broader way for others to contribute to HeroPress.</p>\n<p>Since HeroPress doesn’t exist without its contributors, I consulted them first and got a universal, resounding, “YES!”.</p>\n<p>So as of today you’ll find a “Donate” button in the menu at the top of the site.</p>\n<h3>What will donations be used for?</h3>\n<p>I’m glad you asked! A variety of things.</p>\n<p>First, I’ll have resources to sink back into the project. Hosting has been donated, but I’d like to be able to do things like pay Stacey to make banners for the older essays that don’t have them, continue to pay her to make new banners each week, and some other things similar to that.</p>\n<p>Second, I’d like to be able to visit WordCamps on behalf of HeroPress. Donations would allow me to set aside money to travel either to camps I’ve been invited to by previous contributors or to new areas and introduce them to the project.</p>\n<p>Lastly, it helps cover my time spent on HeroPress. This project is (and will continue to be) a labor of love, but it still eats up about 5 hours of my week that I’m not spending with my family. While the project isn’t in danger of disappearing, donations simply help share the weight of the project.</p>\n<h3>Where can I Give?</h3>\n<h2><a href=\"https://heropress.com/give/\">Right Here</a></h2>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Accepting Donations\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Accepting%20Donations&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Faccepting-donations%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Accepting Donations\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Faccepting-donations%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Faccepting-donations%2F&title=Accepting+Donations\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Accepting Donations\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/accepting-donations/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/icons_logo_overlay-150x150.jpg&description=Accepting Donations\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Accepting Donations\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/accepting-donations/\" title=\"Accepting Donations\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/accepting-donations/\">Accepting Donations</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 20 Oct 2017 12:00:26 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: From Building WordPress Sites to Selling Plugins in One Year\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=75888\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://wptavern.com/from-building-wordpress-sites-to-selling-plugins-in-one-year\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13261:\"<img />Katie Keith\n<p>This is a guest post written by <span class=\"st\"><a href=\"https://barn2.co.uk/team/katie-keith/\">Katie Keith</a>, co-founder of <a href=\"https://barn2.co.uk/\">Barn2 Media</a>. In this post, Keith shares the lessons she and her husband learned transitioning from client work to selling WordPress products in one year.<br />\n</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p>If you’ve ever dreamed of quitting client work and earning passive income by selling WordPress themes and plugins, you’re not alone. Selling products instead of providing services is the holy grail for many WordPress professionals.</p>\n<p>This is the story of how I switched from building websites to selling plugins in just one year. Along the way, I’ve made a lot of mistakes and learned some valuable lessons. Here’s how you can make the switch too.</p>\n<h2>Seven Years Building WordPress Websites</h2>\n<p>I co-founded UK WordPress studio Barn2 Media in late 2009 with my husband Andy. We had always wanted to work for ourselves, and felt that web design was the perfect way to combine our skills. (His background is in web development; mine is project management and marketing.)</p>\n<p>For the next seven years, we built the business by designing WordPress websites for clients, both in the UK and worldwide. We were successful and always had more work than we needed. However, from very early on, we both aspired to sell our own products instead of building websites for other people.</p>\n<h2>Our Transition Into A Plugin Business</h2>\n<p>Working with clients is great, and you get to know a lot of interesting people from different walks of life. But as a business owner, I found it frustrating to spend all of my time helping other people to build their business, with very little time to develop my own. I wanted to run a business where I could reap the rewards of my hard work. And that’s where products come in!</p>\n<p>In the early days of the business, we tried launching a few products in our spare time, without success. In 2016, we committed to transforming Barn2 Media into a premium plugins company.</p>\n<p>Within three months, we had launched two free plugins and a paid one. Within six months of our product focus, we were able to stop accepting new client work. Within a year, we had five premium plugins. Income from the plugin business overtook the original client business, and we haven’t looked back since.</p>\n<img />Plugin Sales Report\n<h2>Lesson #1: Commit by Any Means Necessary</h2>\n<p>A lot of WordPress professionals try to develop themes or plugins as a side business, alongside their client projects. Some have found success that way, but it’s much more difficult. I tried this in 2012-13, and failed miserably.</p>\n<p>In 2012, the WordPress themes industry was less mature and some fairly simple themes were seeing huge success. We wanted a piece of the pie, and started building a simple multipurpose theme.</p>\n<p>The reality of day-to-day client work made it difficult to commit much time to the theme. Before we knew it, a year had passed before we were ready to submit it to ThemeForest (our chosen marketplace due to the easy route to market). By then, the themes industry had changed and was dominated by much more advanced themes that we didn’t have the resources to compete with. The market had moved on, leaving us behind.</p>\n<p>When we started building plugins in early 2016, we learned from this mistake. Andy stopped designing websites for clients, and focused 100% on the plugins. I continued with some client projects, but dedicated 50% of my time to marketing.</p>\n<p>It was scary to intentionally limit our income by turning down client work &#8211; especially when there are bills for pay. Fortunately, the extra commitment was worth it. We made excellent progress and got our plugins to market quickly. This made all of the difference.</p>\n<p>If you want to build a successful theme or plugins business, commit as much time as possible to it &#8211; even if it means a short-term drop in income. You may still need to do some client work to pay the bills, but do the absolute minimum and don’t be afraid to say <strong>No</strong>. This will make you much likelier to succeed.</p>\n<h2>Lesson #2 &#8211; Go Niche, and Avoid Marketplace Fees</h2>\n<p>When we were developing a theme, we planned to sell it on ThemeForest because we’d struggle to achieve the same level of exposure ourselves. We knew we’d have to give away a huge percentage of our income in commission, but figured that it’s better to have a 50% of something than 100% of nothing.</p>\n<p>Since then, I’ve learned that you can have your cake and eat it too. The trick is to create niche products where you have a reasonable chance of getting the exposure you need.</p>\n<p>To illustrate this point, let’s look at our first plugin &#8211; <a href=\"https://barn2.co.uk/wordpress-plugins/woocommerce-password-protected-categories/\">WooCommerce Password Protected Categories</a>. It solves a very specific problem, and is about as niche as you can get! We could have sold it on a marketplace such as CodeCanyon, who would have priced it at about $25. After commission, we’d have received $12.50-$17.50 per sale.</p>\n<p>Instead, we decided to sell the plugin directly on our own website. After researching the cost of similar plugins, we set the price at $75.</p>\n<p>With those costs, it would only be worth using a marketplace if it would get 500% more sales. However, ‘WooCommerce password protected categories’ is a very niche keyword and quickly reached number one in Google.</p>\n<p>This put it directly in front of people who were looking for this solution. When I compare our sales figures with other plugins on CodeCanyon, I’m confident that we’ve had just as many sales from selling direct &#8211; with much higher revenue and profit margin.</p>\n<p>If you’re switching to plugin sales and don’t have a huge marketing budget, do your research and create niche plugins to meet a specific need. The WordPress market is so huge that there are plenty of people looking for solutions &#8211; even very niche ones.</p>\n<h2>Lesson #3 &#8211; Get Ideas From Your Clients</h2>\n<p>As a client-facing WordPress company, you’re in a unique position to know what your clients want. When a client requests a new feature for their website, you probably research suitable plugins. If you’ve ever failed to find a suitable plugin, you’ve found a potential gap in the market!</p>\n<p>This is how we ended up with our bestselling plugin. A client wanted a table listing all of their blog posts. We didn’t find any WordPress table plugins that could do this dynamically, so we developed a bespoke plugin for the client. Later, we released an <a href=\"https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/posts-data-table/\">enhanced version</a> to the WordPress plugin repository.</p>\n<p>After launching the free table plugin, we immediately started getting requests from users wanting to list other WordPress post types in a table. We launched <a href=\"https://barn2.co.uk/wordpress-plugins/posts-table-pro/\">Posts Table Pro</a> as a premium plugin to solve this problem.</p>\n<p>Posts Table Pro was (and still is) quite popular, but we quickly discovered that a lot of our customers were using it to list WooCommerce products in a table. We received lots of requests for dedicated WooCommerce features such as Add to Cart buttons. In response, we developed <a href=\"https://barn2.co.uk/wordpress-plugins/woocommerce-product-table/\">WooCommerce Product Table</a> which has been hugely successful.</p>\n<img />Plugin Ideas\n<p>We never came up with the idea for a WooCommerce table plugin. It was a gradual journey that started with an unrelated request from a client.</p>\n<p>You can do the same. Use your web design clients as a starting point for finding gaps in the market. Go with the flow and evolve new ideas wherever you see demand. If you’re flexible, you can eventually end up with a bestselling plugin!</p>\n<h2>Lesson #4 &#8211; Focus on Professionalism</h2>\n<p>However good your plugins are, they will only sell if people trust you and are confident in buying from you. This is easy if you’re a big name and have a known brand. Unfortunately, we didn’t have those luxuries!</p>\n<p>Barn2 Media is well-known as a WordPress agency, but not as a plugin company. We had to work hard to reassure customers that we’re a professional company that they can safely buy from.</p>\n<p>Here’s how you can do the same:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure your overall website is professional and has the attention to detail that people will expect from your products.</li>\n<li>Add extra trust factors to your website, such as badges and logos.</li>\n<li>Create well designed sales pages with plenty of information such as screenshots and demo videos.</li>\n<li>Show customer reviews on the sales page. To get started, add a testimonial from one of your web design clients. Once more people are using your product, you can replace it with a full reviews section.</li>\n<li>Design a comprehensive demo site for your themes or plugins.</li>\n<li>Use well-known payment providers.</li>\n<li>Add an <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/more-than-50-of-web-traffic-is-now-encrypted\">SSL certificate</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These details definitely make a difference. Every time we’ve taken steps to make our website more professional, we’ve seen a big jump in sales. A lot of small theme and plugin companies fall at this hurdle and their products get lost behind an unprofessional website &#8211; don’t let the same happen to you.</p>\n<h2>Lesson #5 &#8211; Don’t Let Customer Support Overwhelm You<i></i></h2>\n<img />photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ironrodart/4154904299/\">IronRodArt &#8211; Royce Bair (&#8220;Star Shooter&#8221;)</a> &#8211; <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/\">cc</a>\n<p>One of my biggest fears in switching to plugin sales was that customer support would be just as time-consuming as supporting clients. In our first few months of selling plugins, every sale seemed to demand a large amount of support. We couldn’t imagine how we would cope with a big increase in sales.</p>\n<p>We overcame this by designing every part of the plugin business in a way that would reduce the need for support:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Build a searchable knowledge library for your documentation and FAQ’s. Make sure customers can only see the ‘Request Support’ link <i>after</i> searching the knowledge library.</li>\n<li>Create a confirmation email with clear setup instructions and links to the knowledge base.</li>\n<li>Add explanatory notes and links to the documentation to your settings pages.</li>\n<li>View every support request as a learning opportunity. How can you prevent other customers from asking the same question in future?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s vital to provide excellent customer support, whether you do it yourself or outsource it. But there’s nothing wrong with helping customers to help themselves, so they’re unlikely to contact you in the first place. This lets us provide better support, build direct relationships with our customers, and constantly improve our plugins and documentation to reduce the need for support even further.</p>\n<p>We originally thought that we’d have to outsource plugin support. In the end, we managed to scale the plugin business to 200+ sales per month while still only spending an hour or two a day on support.</p>\n<h2>Lesson #6 &#8211; Your Old Clients Are A Safety Net, Not A Burden</h2>\n<p>If you’ve been designing websites for a while, then you probably have quite a few existing clients under your belt. It’s easy to see them as a distraction when you’re trying to focus on new goals. Instead, view them as an extra income stream that will provide financial security through your leap into the unknown.</p>\n<p>We host and maintain over 70 websites that we previously developed. We stopped taking on new clients over a year ago, but still take care of our original clients. This doesn’t take much of our time because the hosting and maintenance arrangements are already in place, and it’s easy to make small changes to websites we built ourselves.</p>\n<p>These websites were a lot of work to develop, but now provide a vital stream of passive income. This allowed us to stop taking on new clients more quickly while the income from the plugin business played catch-up. It’s also a safety net in case the plugin industry takes a downturn in the future.</p>\n<h2>Putting It Into Practice</h2>\n<p>After dreaming about it for so many years, I’m so proud that we finally made the transition from designing websites to selling plugins. It wasn’t easy, but when we fully committed to switching to plugins, everything came together and we haven’t looked back.</p>\n<p>When you’re <i>focused</i> on client projects, it’s hard to rise above the day-to-day grind and prioritize product development. Many people have written about the difficulties of starting a theme or plugin business, given the amount of competition and the maturity of the market. By following the lessons in this article, I believe that you can create a space for yourself and find the success you deserve.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 20 Oct 2017 05:08:26 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:91:\"WPTavern: AMP Project Turns 2,  Automattic Partners with Google to Improve WordPress Plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=75859\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"https://wptavern.com/amp-project-turns-2-automattic-partners-with-google-to-improve-wordpress-plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8308:\"<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-19-at-1.50.42-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Google&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.ampproject.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AMP</a> (Accelerated Mobile Pages) project is two years old today and the company published <a href=\"https://amphtml.wordpress.com/2017/10/19/amp-two-years-of-user-first-webpages/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">data</a> demonstrating its growing adoption across the web. More than 4 billion AMP pages have been published by 25 million domains. AMP performance has also increased and Google reports that the median time for loading AMP pages from its search engine is less than half a second.</p>\n<p>The AMP team also cited several examples of success for sites that have integrated AMP, along with an as yet unpublished Forrester Consulting Total Economic Impact<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> study that linked AMP to a 10% increase in website traffic and a 2X increase in time spent on the page. The study, which was commissioned by Google, also showed that AMP pages on e-commerce sites have a 20% increase in sales conversions as compared to non-AMP pages.</p>\n<p>Google credited AMP&#8217;s 400+ code contributors and the 10,500 others who have engaged on GiHub, along with <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Automattic</a>, one of the earliest publishing partners on the project:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We’re also seeing other organizations take an increasingly proactive role in supporting AMP. Automattic, for example, has been working with us to improve the quality of the WordPress plug-in over the past several months. In addition to strong adoption across the community, WordPress.com VIP clients like <a href=\"https://vip.wordpress.com/2017/10/19/happy-second-birthday-amp/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The New York Post and PMC have seen great results</a> with their implementations.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordPress.com&#8217;s VIP team also <a href=\"https://vip.wordpress.com/2017/10/19/happy-second-birthday-amp/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">published</a> specific instances where their clients have benefited from AMPing up their articles.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Across Automattic (including WordPress.com and VIP) hundreds of millions of client page views per month are delivered through AMP today,&#8221; WordPress.com VIP Strategic Partnerships director Tamara Sanderson said. &#8220;Over the last two years, many of our clients and partner agencies have customized and optimized the AMP experience for their particular needs, with impressive results.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>AMP WordPress Plugin Updated after 10 Months</h3>\n<p>Automattic updated its <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AMP WordPress plugin</a> two months ago, but the average WordPress site owner doesn&#8217;t have the budget to customize and tweak it to achieve success. Users haven&#8217;t fared well with the open source plugin, which went for approximately 10 months without any updates. Many have encountered difficulties ranging from activation errors to  incompatibilities with other plugins, problems with analytics, and validation errors. Users also cannot get support on the WordPress.org forums and 0/39 support issues have been resolved in the past two months.</p>\n<p>Although there are several alternative plugins in the directory for implementing AMP on WordPress sites, Automattic, as a partner with Google on the AMP initiative, seems to the best positioned to author the official plugin with the company&#8217;s experience AMPing up pages at scale. Automattic is still committed to improving the plugin but users may need to hire a professional developer for AMP-related plugin support.</p>\n<p>Version 0.5, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/#developers\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">released in August 2017</a>, included just a handful of updates for having been 10 months in development. The release brought the plugin closer to the AMP spec, replaced fastimage with fasterimage for PHP 5.4+, and added support for new embed handlers, including Vimeo, SoundCloud, and Pinterest.</p>\n<h3>Automattic Aims to Work with Google to Push AMP to be more Open</h3>\n<p>Throughout the past year, AMP has come under fire from critics who believe that it is harmful to the open web. By default AMP forces users to load JavaScript from the AMP project site, loads the cached content from its own servers, and uses a subset of HTML that optimizes pages to benefit Google and Google search users.</p>\n<p>Many critics take issue with the fact that Google is incentivizing AMP&#8217;s use by prioritizing AMP pages in search results. It&#8217;s easy to forget that Google Search, with its overwhelmingly dominant market share among search engines, is not a public service to the world. It&#8217;s a company that seeks to make a profit. Can the AMP project be open enough to stay immune to Google&#8217;s drive for profit?</p>\n<p>WordPress.com was one of the first publishers to partner with Google on this initiative to speed up the mobile web. While attending WordCamp Europe 2017, I asked Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg how AMP can be good for the open web, despite how much control publishers are required to yield when it comes to their mobile content. Mullenweg said that he sees pluses and minuses in what AMP currently provides to users.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The things I like about AMP is it removes a lot of cruft and it’s ultra-fast,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Now if I see an AMP link I’m more likely to click on that than other things. I know I’m not going to get some weird popup that redirects my browser to the app store or anything like that. I think that is good and necessary.&#8221; He also said he disliked a few of the downsides that critics bring up but thinks that those can be worked out in time.</p>\n<p>“WordPress was very early in adopting responsive pages,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;Also some plugins, including Jetpack, that do a mobile version of a site, do create a better experience and are a big reason why people have adopted WordPress in the past.</p>\n<p>&#8220;AMP is the next version of that. It is more open and standard than what we’ve done in the past and I could see it becoming a much more inclusive thing than it is. Given that that is one of Automattic’s core principles as well, we’re going to work with Google to try to push it that direction and try to bring a lot of the web along with it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The alternatives out there, like say Facebook’s proprietary Instant Articles format, are not necessarily better, especially if they tie you into one form of monetization, like Facebook’s ads. So I do believe that AMP has the potential to be much more open and in line with WordPress’ ideal version of that, but it is imperfect as it stands today.”</p>\n<p>For now it seems Google considers AMP to be a success, as adoption has increased and the project is undoubtedly achieving its goal of improving performance for mobile pages. The company is working on delivering better, faster ads to users, as many publishers have experienced <a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/publishers-find-google-amp-loads-fast-ad-views/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">decreased revenues associated with ads loading much slower than the actual content</a>.</p>\n<p>The project is still young and Google has a fine line to walk in order to deliver value without overstepping its reach. It may not be long before AMP support becomes Google&#8217;s the next official ranking signal. Site speed is already one of the search engine&#8217;s considerations in delivering traffic, so AMPed pages already influence which sites are featured in search results, which in turn affects ad performance and site monetization.</p>\n<p>For the average WordPress site owner, adding AMP support still requires overcoming a number of technical hurdles. With Automattic committed to supporting and improving the AMP experience for its VIP clients, it should not be long before the larger publishers and their agency partners are able to iron out more of the difficulties that have kept AMP integration from being seamless for all WordPress users.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 19 Oct 2017 23:54:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"WPTavern: WooCommerce Stores on Track to Surpass $10B in Sales This Year\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=75861\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-stores-on-track-to-surpass-10b-in-sales-this-year\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4585:\"<p>The third annual <a href=\"https://wooconf.com/\">WooConf</a>, the official conference for <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/\">WooCommerce</a>, is underway today. It started off with a keynote by Todd Wilkens, Head of WooCommerce, providing an overview of the project&#8217;s accomplishments over the past year and a preview of what&#8217;s to come.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/wooconf?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#wooconf</a> — <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WooCommerce?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@woocommerce</a> <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f60a.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f44d.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> <a href=\"https://t.co/8l07LgLd1y\">pic.twitter.com/8l07LgLd1y</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; John Kent (@johnkentsf) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnkentsf/status/921054095120756737?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 19, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>When the crowd was asked to guess how much in sales WooCommerce stores would generate this year, guesses ranged from $10M to $1B. According to Wilkens, WooCommerce stores will collectively generate more than $10B in sales this year and says the figure could be as high as $15B. WooCommerce extension sales are expected to generate more than $30M.</p>\n<p>Wilkens thanked and acknowledged <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/graphs/contributors\">the 616 contributors</a> working on the platform. He then outlined three distinct user segments the company is catering too: store builders, store owners, and extension developers. These user segments are causing the company to reorganize internally and are providing the focus for features going forward.</p>\n<p>WooCommerce is used by a lot of small-to-medium sized businesses but it&#8217;s also used by businesses that generate $100M or more per year. Wilkens profiled <a href=\"https://www.heb.com/\">H-E-B</a>, a large grocery retailer in Texas that uses WooCommerce for its sister company, <a href=\"http://centralmarket.com/\">Central Market</a>. WebDevStudios <a href=\"https://webdevstudios.com/portfolio/central-market/\">built the site</a> on WordPress and used WooCommerce to handle the company&#8217;s eCommerce needs.</p>\n<h2>Coming to A WooCommerce Near You</h2>\n<p>WooCommerce is making investments into its design and user experience with the insight of <a href=\"https://design.blog/2016/08/08/john-maeda/\">John Maeda</a>, the company&#8217;s Global Head of Computational Design and Inclusion. The company is also investing in user research, testing, interviews, feedback, and doing what they can to learn about its users needs.</p>\n<p>He acknowledged the hiccups users encountered when upgrading <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-3-0-brings-major-improvements-to-product-gallery-introduces-crud-classes-and-a-new-cli\">sites to WooCommerce 3.0</a> earlier this year and says the experience has placed a heavier emphasis to establish a reliable upgrade and maintenance path.</p>\n<p>WooCommerce will combine its affiliate program with WordPress.com so that everything is managed under one roof. As WooCommerce has improved, it has also developed closer ties to Jetpack and WordPress.com in order to provide additional services.</p>\n<p>Automattic has years of experience building and maintaining SaaS infrastructures. Instead of creating a separate infrastructure for WooCommerce, the team decided to leverage Automattic&#8217;s infrastructure with Jetpack. We&#8217;ll publish more about this relationship in a future article.</p>\n<p>WooCommerce will revamp its mobile application and is opening its marketplace to extension authors. Extension authors can expect higher commissions, more control, and better access to their customers. Authors will also be able to provide support to their own customers on the site.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, WooCommerce <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-drops-50-renewal-discount-on-subscriptions\">dropped its 50% renewal discount</a> forcing customers to pay full-price without explicitly notifying them. Near the end of keynote, Wilkens provided context for the move saying it was about sustainability. Although comments on the article indicated that many customers were upset with the change, Wilkens says it has proven to be successful and has led to a substantial improvement in customer support.</p>\n<p>Those involved in the WooCommerce ecosystem can expect to see many more changes to both the website and platform in the coming months.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 19 Oct 2017 22:30:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"Dev Blog: WordPress 4.9 Beta 3\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4953\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/10/wordpress-4-9-beta-3/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3430:\"<p>WordPress 4.9 Beta 3 is now available!</p>\n<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site.

Microsoft is calling it &#8220;the biggest enhancement to OpenType since the OpenType specification was first released nineteen years ago.&#8221; The company&#8217;s announcement, published in 2016, describes a few of the most important advantages of OpenType Variable Fonts:</p>\n<blockquote><p>OpenType Font Variations enables web site designers and application developers to deliver typographically rich experiences while using very little network bandwidth and small font files. Variable fonts will also give document creators a broad palette of typographic features without having to manage hundreds of font files. Variable fonts are all about doing more with less.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Last year, after OpenType Font Variations were added to version 1.8 of the OpenType font format specification, <a href=\"http://www.tiro.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Tiro Typeworks</a> co-founder John Hudson wrote an excellent <a href=\"https://medium.com/@tiro/https-medium-com-tiro-introducing-opentype-variable-fonts-12ba6cd2369\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> explaining how variable fonts work and their potential impact on typography in the future:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The potential for dynamic selection of custom instances within the variations design space — or design-variations space, to use its technical name — opens exciting prospects for fine tuning the typographic palette, and for new kinds of responsive typography that can adapt to best present dynamic content to a reader’s device, screen orientation, or even reading distance.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Variable fonts are currently in development for Microsoft Edge and the team is also working on a <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-3/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">formal proposal to add support to CSS</a>.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Just submitted the PR, should be live on the status site soon.

Although GoDaddy currently has 4 million customers running on WordPress, its more basic plans were not adequate for those who require additional tools to manage multiple sites and clients in one place.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our new Managed WordPress platform is for WordPress professionals, which we’ve struggled to serve well in the past,&#8221;    GoDaddy&#8217;s Head of WordPress, Gabriel Mays, said. &#8220;We’re fixing that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pro WordPress, a product the company teased at WordCamp Europe 2017, uses PHP 7.1 as the default, Kubernetes container management, and gives each site isolated, dedicated resources. It also includes ManageWP premium tools (<a href=\"https://www.godaddy.com/pro/managewp?isc=cardigan\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GoDaddy Pro Sites</a>), 90 days of backups powered by ManageWP, staging site environment, a Gravity Forms license, a library of 10,000+ free stock images, scanning and monitoring powered by Sucuri, and free SSL automatically installed on every site.</p>\n<p>GoDaddy&#8217;s new offering is aggressively priced at $10/month for one site and ranges to $99/month for 25 sites. Mays said that hosting millions of WordPress sites has allowed GoDaddy to gain economies of scale and pass on the savings to customers. For comparison, WP Engine&#8217;s personal plan <a href=\"https://wpengine.com/plans/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pricing</a> starts at $25/month for one site and $249/month for 25 sites. Flywheel&#8217;s bulk <a href=\"https://getflywheel.com/pricing/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pricing</a> starts at $92/month for 10 installs and $229/month for up to 30 sites. SiteGround is still somewhat of an outlier with unlimited installs for any of its <a href=\"https://www.siteground.com/wordpress-hosting.htm\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">bulk WordPress hosting plans</a>, which begin at $5.95/month and range to $11.95/month.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our chief competitors are other hosts who serve Web Pros like WP Engine, SiteGround, and others,&#8221; Mays said. &#8220;We differentiate in performance, quality, and value. For example, while our competitors serve their products from a shared environment, we don’t. Our customers get a fully containerized environment with isolated resources. This delivers high performance and failover for high redundancy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>GoDaddy&#8217;s WordPress customer base continues to outpace the growth of the market. In 2016, roughly one third of all GoDaddy sites were running on WordPress, and half of all new sites were using the software. Over the past several years, GoDaddy has been working to overcome its poor reputation in the WordPress community. During that time, the company acquired several large WordPress-related products to boost its offerings in the space, including ManageWP (<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/godaddy-acquires-wordpress-site-management-service-managewp\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">September 2016</a>), WP Curve (<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/godaddy-acquires-wp-curve-aims-to-become-a-one-stop-shop-for-wordpress-professionals\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">December 2016</a>), and Sucuri (<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/godaddy-acquires-sucuri\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">March 2017)</a>.</p>\n<p>The acquisition of these products, as well as partnerships with Gravity Forms, Beaver Builder, and WP101, were all milestones in what Mays said is GoDaddy&#8217;s goal &#8211; to become &#8220;a one-stop shop for WordPress professionals.” The company continues to invest in the community by sponsoring WordCamps globally and supporting WordPress security team lead Aaron Campbell as a full-time core contributor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Five years ago, GoDaddy wasn’t involved in the WordPress community; we were the mammoth host that made money off of WordPress without giving back,&#8221; Mays said. &#8220;We’ve made some big strides in changing that, and will continue to ramp up our commitment to the WordPress community.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 18 Oct 2017 21:57:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:38:\"HeroPress: Be Brave and Trust Yourself\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2172\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:128:\"https://heropress.com/essays/be-brave-and-trust-yourself/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=be-brave-and-trust-yourself\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11558:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/101717-min-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: Choose to be brave and trust yourself.\" /><h3>Beginnings</h3>\n<p>I was born into a working-class family in Targoviste, a small town in Romania situated around 50 miles from the capital, Bucharest. My childhood was a normal one, mostly happy but marked negatively by the frequent conflicts between my parents.</p>\n<p>Growing up, they didn’t have much to offer to me and my brother. They struggled to give us as much as possible, and at the end, they did offer us quite a decent life, but all those shortages can be quite difficult to understand, especially for a child.</p>\n<p>“Why the other kids can have things that I don’t have?”</p>\n<p>“Why didn’t my parents gave me more?”</p>\n<p>I knew since then, part of the answer. They didn’t give me more because they didn’t have more, not because they didn’t want to. Thinking more about this, years later, I actually realized, that this whole situation was actually more of a blessing for me, and I am now really grateful for it.</p>\n<p>Why I’m saying this?</p>\n<p>Because not having everything gave me an incredible motivation to grow, overcome my situation, be creative and don’t ever give up on my dreams.</p>\n<h3>Facing the world</h3>\n<p>Wanting to do great things with my life, I always knew that staying in my small town forever is not an option.<br />\nSo, at 19, after finishing high school, I got admitted to Politehnica University of Bucharest, to study Computer Science. My brother was the one that convinced me to pursue this subject of study, as I wasn’t very sure on which path I should choose because I was not having enough self-confidence that I would be good at it, even though I always was better at this fields of study in school.</p>\n<p>I have to thank him for that.</p>\n<p>Going to University was by far the most important moment in my life at that time. It was hard but beautiful at the same time, the whole experience. At first, it was a total shock for me. Between all the big changes in my life, like leaving home for the first time, living in a college dorm with three new girls, taking care of myself and all that, school was not that easy anymore either. Even though I always liked studying and was one of the best students in my class, University was at a totally different level.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It was really difficult to adjust, as I started to think again that maybe I wasn’t good enough for this, that it’s not something I can do, and I should give up.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Luckily I didn’t do that, and with lots of work, in time, I managed to adapt and eventually finish the University with both a Bachelor’s degree and Master’s degree in Computer Science.</p>\n<p>From my second year at University, I started thinking seriously that I should start working. I always wanted to have financial independence, as I also knew deep down, how difficult it would be for my parents to sustain me over the course of the next years of study. So, I started to search for jobs. I had so little self-confidence that I thought that nobody will ever hire me, so I took the first job offer that I received.</p>\n<p>I started to work part-time as a junior web developer at a small IT company. Looking back at that time, I can’t say I learned much there, as the company itself and the people in charge of it were not very interested in teaching me something or giving me interesting projects, so I could evolve professionally. And this was not happening just for me. Months later I realized this was their thing. They were mostly hiring students, paying them very small salaries and in some ways taking advantages of them. For example, in my case, they didn’t make me a contract even after 6 months there, even though they promised me that since day one. So, I was working illegally all that time, with no paid taxes, with a salary of just 90$ a month.</p>\n<p>But considering all this, I’m honestly happy I’ve had the chance to work there. I didn’t have the chance to learn much programming there, but I learned other valuable things that helped me through my life. All I’ve experienced that time, gave me a much more sense of what the world really is. And it made me realize that I want more, that I deserve more. There had to be something better out there.</p>\n<p>Plus, there is where I met my fiance <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n<h3>Finding my way</h3>\n<p>I started to search for a new job and lucky enough, in a couple of days I started working at Codeinwp.com. At that time, it was a really small agency, in a tiny office, with only two other employees besides me. We were all kind of the same age, students with no money, no major work ( or as a matter of fact, even life ) experience but with big ambitions. It was obvious for me, from the start, that this was a very different company than the one where I’ve worked before. I got my contract signed in the first two days, I got payed better, I got interesting projects to work on, I got people helping me learn.</p>\n<a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-2173\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_1.jpg\" alt=\"Rodica at WordCamp\" width=\"300\" height=\"450\" /></a>WordCamp Europe 2017 Paris, The Afterparty\n<p>And I got something that I didn’t know existed in other companies. I got freedom and trust. Lots of trust.</p>\n<p>The company is co-founded by Ionut Neagu, who was at that moment living in France. And he was running the business from there, miles away from us, not knowing what we’re doing all the time. I don’t think many people would be able to do this. And do it successfully.</p>\n<p>I also think that part of his success in running this business is his way of being, as he is genuinely one of the most generous and kind-hearted people I’ve met. Always there for everyone.</p>\n<h3>The Breakthrough</h3>\n<p>The first couple of years in the company were a bit tough, especially for Ionut, as he had to always find new projects and customers to make sure we are making enough money to sustain us all. At that time, I didn’t realized that, but now I understand how difficult it was for him sometimes, and I appreciate him more.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Here is where I also first encountered WordPress. It was a new concept, not just for me, but for the other guys too. And we started to learn it, step by step, project by project. And it changed our lives.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In 2014, the whole company made a risky change, that proved, in time, to be a great choice. We launched Themeisle.com, a marketplace for our own WordPress themes and plugins, and also launched Zerif Lite, that gradually became one of the most popular themes on the wordpress.org repository. Currently is used by more than 100.000 users.</p>\n<p>The road was not an easy one, but 5 years later, almost 500,000 people in the world are using our products. I still can’t believe that so many people are influenced by something that I’ve done. Always thought that is difficult for a common man to have an impact on the world. But I had an impact too, in my own way.</p>\n<h3>Discovering The World</h3>\n<p>The first time I visited a foreign country was in 2014, at WordCamp Europe in Sofia, Bulgaria. I remember it like yesterday. It was so exciting for me. Though, I don’t think I’ve realized, at that time, the true meaning and dimensions of a WordCamp and all the great things happening in the community. I think I was too amazed of just having the opportunity to travel. But this was not going to stop here.</p>\n<p>We got the chance to travel to all major WordCamps in Europe, and discovered the joy of participating as volunteers too ( and organizers now too).</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’ve met so many great people, from all around the globe, I’ve learned so much from all the different cultures.</p></blockquote>\n<a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-2175 size-medium\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_2-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"ThemeIsle Team\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>Part of the team at WordCamp Europe 2017\n<p>And last year, I’ve got the chance to go somewhere I’ve never imagine going. We went to New York, and joined WordCamp US in Philadelphia. It was such an amazing experience for which I’m so grateful, and hope everyone can have this kind of opportunities.</p>\n<h3>In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>I’m so proud of being part of the WordPress community and part of the ThemeIsle team. It’s so rewarding to start working in a small company and see it grow, alongside you. To see it flourish, starting from almost nothing and reaching success, after many challenges and obstacles along the way. As cheesy as it may sound, it’s almost like seeing your child grow and fulfill his dreams.</p>\n<p>And as I mostly struggled thinking I wasn’t better enough at the beginning of my life, all these experiences made me realize that you just have to work for your dreams, don’t ever give up, and realize that always, even though somebody will be better than you, you are better than others. It’s important the direction you choose to look at.</p>\n<p>So choose to be brave and trust yourself.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Be Brave and Trust Yourself\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Be%20Brave%20and%20Trust%20Yourself&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbe-brave-and-trust-yourself%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Be Brave and Trust Yourself\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbe-brave-and-trust-yourself%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbe-brave-and-trust-yourself%2F&title=Be+Brave+and+Trust+Yourself\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Be Brave and Trust Yourself\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/be-brave-and-trust-yourself/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/101717-min-150x150.jpg&description=Be Brave and Trust Yourself\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Be Brave and Trust Yourself\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/be-brave-and-trust-yourself/\" title=\"Be Brave and Trust Yourself\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/be-brave-and-trust-yourself/\">Be Brave and Trust Yourself</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 18 Oct 2017 05:00:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:17:\"Rodica Andronache\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"WPTavern: Medium Opens Partner Program, Allows Anyone to Publish Behind Its $5 Paywall\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=75602\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"https://wptavern.com/medium-opens-partner-program-allows-anyone-to-publish-behind-its-5-paywall\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11215:\"<p>In March 2017, Medium <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/medium-aims-to-fix-broken-media-with-new-5-subscription-program\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">scrapped its previous ad-driven revenue model</a> to become a publisher of premium, subscription-based content. The company launched a new $5 subscription program and gave a select group of writers and publications the ability to publish articles behind a paywall inside its network. Medium&#8217;s invitation-only Partner Program <a href=\"https://blog.medium.com/expanding-the-medium-partner-program-3be09dd146e4\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">launched in August</a> but has now been expanded to include any author or publisher who wants to publish behind the paywall.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Starting today, anyone can enroll in our Partner Program and earn money based on the depth and value they provide to members, not the fleeting attention they deliver to advertisers,&#8221; Medium CEO Ev Williams said. &#8220;Along with that, we add stories from the world’s best publishers and seamlessly combine it all in an ad-free, personalized experience. The end goal is to offer the world&#8217;s best source for important stories and ideas.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Authors are rewarded based on engagement with their posts, as measured by the number of &#8220;clap&#8221; reactions a post receives via the network&#8217;s new <a href=\"https://blog.medium.com/show-authors-more-%EF%B8%8F-with-s-c1652279ba01\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">applause button</a>. Readers can clap multiple times and the system evaluates claps on a per-user basis, tracking the number of claps a reader assigns relative to the number of claps that individual typically sends. Subscribers will have their membership fees allocated to different authors based the claps they have given to posts behind the paywall.</p>\n<p>Medium quickly changed its &#8220;no access&#8221; paywall to a &#8220;metered&#8221; one after launching with a small group of publishers. This means that members can still read a limited number of locked stories each month before hitting the wall. The idea behind this move, according to Sam Duboff, Medium&#8217;s head of product marketing, is to give paywalled posts exposure to a wider audience while still paying content creators, instead of having articles simply get buried due to lack of exposure.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">with our metered paywall, we\'re hoping to enable both reach &amp; $$. also lots of great writers haven\'t joined b/c they can be paid elsewhere.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Sam Duboff (@duboff) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/duboff/status/909849467859345408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 18, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Perhaps, but note the paywall is (now) metered, a la NYT, so free readers can still access (w/login)</p>\n<p>&mdash; Ev Williams (@ev) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ev/status/900067262031290368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 22, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Some authors have posted publicly about their earnings and Medium representatives told <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/10/medium-opens-up-its-partner-program-allowing-anyone-to-publish-behind-its-paywall/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">TechCrunch</a> that 83% of those who published paywalled stories received payments during the month of September with payments averaging $93.65.

After failing to find success with this model, Medium has repackaged itself as a publisher of subscription-based content and aims to throw a wide net by calling its partner program &#8220;<a href=\"http://medium.com/creators\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the internet’s first open paywall</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;And while many publishers are looking towards subscriptions as an alternative to the deleterious effects of ads (a move we support for everyone), Medium is the only &#8216;open paywall&#8217; for thoughtful content on the internet,&#8221; Williams said. &#8220;Which means, we tap into the ideas and expertise of thousands of the smartest minds on the planet — many of whom made Medium what it is today — to bring fresh perspectives to Medium members.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite setting out to create “a different, bolder approach,” as Williams called it earlier this year, the company has landed on a cheap paywall that is open to any content creator. Putting content behind a paywall isn&#8217;t a good strategy for individuals or businesses that depend on their products and ideas getting maximum exposure. It&#8217;s also <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/publishers-are-moving-back-to-wordpress-after-short-experiments-with-medium\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">not a sustainable model for larger publishers</a>, several of which Medium had wooed to its platform before suddenly shifting its business strategy.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our medium publication gets a ton of traffic, but feels shitty to paywall it to make $12 bucks.

There is a lot we need to figure out to make this work right. But we are convinced that by joining forces, we can make a new economic model for quality content.

Gutenberg&#8217;s current design trajectory doesn&#8217;t seem to be putting it on track for delivering the minimalist writing environment that many writers crave. The project has a lot of publishing and design-related functionality to account for in its UI, but I am hopeful that the plugin ecosystem will offer extensions that pare Gutenberg back to just the essentials for writing.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, those in search of a minimalist writing experience have found it in dedicated writing apps like iA Writer, Ulysses, WriteRoom, OmmWriter, and others. The <a href=\"http://www.bear-writer.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bear app</a>, a newcomer launched in 2016, is a rising favorite that works on iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Although somewhat better known as a note-taking app, Bear&#8217;s beautiful writing experience won the app a <a href=\"https://blog.bear-writer.com/thank-you-yes-you-for-our-2017-apple-design-award-1b13e702ee91\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2017 Apple Design Award</a>.</p>\n<p>Bear blends the best features of a note-taking app with a writing app. Users can turn on Focus Mode using the bottom right icon, which hides the sidebar and note list to provide a more minimal writing space. Bear saves users&#8217; writing in real-time, offers in-line support for images, and syntax highlighting for 20+ programming languages. There are no distractions while the user is composing, as the editor instantly displays rich previews. It&#8217;s easy to see why Bear has become an instant favorite.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-10-13-at-12.29.28-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Many Bear users still have the need to publish their writings to the web, a capability that the app doesn&#8217;t currently support. Naturally, a WordPress export or &#8220;Publish to WordPress&#8221; option is one of the most often requested features. However, <a href=\"http://www.shinyfrog.net/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Shiny Frog</a>, the company behind the Bear app, is not yet working on publishing features.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Medium and WordPress publishing features are on our todo list, but not on top priority right now,&#8221; Shiny Frog co-founder Danilo Bonardi <a href=\"http://help.shinyfrog.net/discussions/bear/2477-export-to-wordpress\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> when I asked last November about the company&#8217;s plans to support a WordPress export option.</p>\n<p>Other users have also posted to the app&#8217;s <a href=\"http://help.shinyfrog.net/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">support forum</a> and its <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bearapp/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">subreddit</a>, asking for WordPress integration:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m really enjoying using Bear for my writing, and the newer features are great, but I&#8217;m trying to get started with my own blog and more as I am developing my own business and being able to export to WordPress would be incredibly helpful for me going forward.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>This is the one feature that would allow me to switch from Ulysses.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>With Ulysses going to a (more expensive) subscription, the time seems right for Bear to offer a &#8220;publish to WordPress&#8221; feature that could match what Ulysses offers. This is about the only thing holding Bear back for me.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m currently deciding between Bear and Ulysses, and right now the dealbreaker is Ulysses&#8217;s ability to push to WordPress. If you were able to build that functionality, it would seal the deal!</p></blockquote>\n<p>Bonardi <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bearapp/comments/6z9qum/feature_request_medium_integration/dmurk7m/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">confirmed</a> again, as recently as last month, that the company is still keeping a tight focus and has not yet prioritized publishing to WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Publishing features have been asked before and we will address them sooner or later,&#8221; Bonardi said. &#8220;Our hopes are to integrate Bear with Medium/WordPress apps instead of implementing our own publishing tool with their APIs. Using their APIs is the other solution but in this scenario we have to build a specific UI for this functionality instead of relying on external apps.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Bear App support staff recommends using the Markdown export option, available in the free version. Additional export options, including HTML, are available Bear&#8217;s $14.99 per year Pro version, which is much more affordable than pricey competitors like <a href=\"https://ulyssesapp.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ulysses</a> and others that cater specifically to long-form writing.</p>\n<p>Quadro also has an <a href=\"https://www.quadro.me/themes/unleash-the-bear\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">option to share Bear notes to both Medium and WordPress</a>. However, it&#8217;s not an official Bear utility and the workflow is rather complicated to set up. Users who have tried this option didn&#8217;t find it to save time over simply copying and pasting.</p>\n<h3>WordPress Needs Its Own Beautiful Writing Experience</h3>\n<p>WordPress publishing support for Bear doesn&#8217;t seem to be a major priority for the company at this time, but splitting up the writing and publishing process is a deal breaker for many who want a simple workflow that doesn’t involve copying and pasting between apps.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, what if WordPress could be known for its beautiful writing experience in core, without a user having to resort to plugins or third-party apps to get there? This seems like a reasonable expectation for Gutenberg, but the project has the added challenge of incorporating a lot of publishing, media, and legacy functionality into its UI in a way that is easily discoverable.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this has resulted in an interface that is constantly popping into view. With the right combination of clicks and hovers, a user can end up in situation like the one shown below in the screenshot &#8211; surrounded by formatting options and icons on all sides.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-10-13-at-1.22.21-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Making it easy to publish to the web, which is WordPress&#8217; forte, isn&#8217;t as compelling if users have to look elsewhere to find a truly distraction-free writing experience.  Fortunately, minimalist writing apps like Bear can fill the gap until the WordPress plugin ecosystem can produce an interface where writing is a delight.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 13 Oct 2017 22:17:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"WPTavern: WordPress 4.9 Protects Users From Fatal Errors Created in the Theme and Plugin Editors\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=75725\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-9-protects-users-from-fatal-errors-created-in-the-theme-and-plugin-editors\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1923:\"<p>Over the years, there have been many discussions and debates on whether or not WordPress should have a built-in file editor for themes and plugins. The file editors, while convenient, allow users to easily trigger fatal errors that can be difficult to fix, especially if they don&#8217;t have FTP access.</p>\n<p>Instead of removing the editors from core, the WordPress development team has enhanced them by adding fatal error protection in WordPress 4.9. When a user accesses the theme or plugin editor for the first time, they&#8217;re presented with the following warnings. The warnings are a result of a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31779\">three-year-old trac ticket</a>.</p>\n<img />Plugin Editor Warning\n<img />Theme Editor Warning\n<p>If you try to save changes to a file and WordPress detects a fatal error, the change is not saved and a warning message is displayed that explains where the error occurred. Although the changes are rolled back, the code in the editor is not replaced with the original. To replace the code, simply refresh the browser tab.</p>\n<img />Fatal Error Detected\n<p>In addition to safety features, the code editors are powered by <a href=\"https://codemirror.net/\">CodeMirror</a>, an open-source, JavaScript powered text editor that adds features such as line numbers. The plugin editor includes the ability to look up documentation for filters, hooks, and actions with many of the links pointing to the new <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/\">WordPress Developers Resource</a> site.</p>\n<p>Even with the addition of CodeMirror in core, the file editors in WordPress are not a replacement for an integrated development environment.

Below is a screenshot of <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/network/dependencies\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg&#8217;s dependency graph</a>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-12-at-11.30.42-AM-e1507825905511.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>GitHub plans to extend dependency graphs to show security alerts when one of the dependencies is using a version that is publicly known to be vulnerable to a security issue. The alerts may also in some cases be able to suggest a security fix. Security alerts for dependencies is the first among a collection of security tools that GitHub has planned to release.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dependency-graph.gif?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The dependency graph isn&#8217;t yet as useful as it could be for many PHP-based WordPress projects, but GitHub&#8217;s decision to start with support for JavaScript and Ruby dependencies is in line with the data the company collected from repositories. JavaScript and Ruby are among the top four most popular languages on GitHub, as measured by the number of pull requests. JavaScript is by far the most popular and PHP isn&#8217;t too far behind Ruby, according to stats from the <a href=\"https://octoverse.github.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">State of the Octoverse 2017</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-12-at-12.35.41-PM-e1507830673184.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>GitHub is also launching new efforts to connect its massive community. The company reported 24 million developers working across 67 million repositories in 2017. The new community features are aimed at helping developers make meaningful connections in the vast sea of repositories on the platform.

The release went into beta at the end of August and an extra week was added to the RC testing phase to give store owners and extension developers ample opportunity to prepare for the update.</p>\n<p>Version 3.2 adds the ability for administrators to apply coupons to existing orders in the backend of the store. This feature was <a href=\"http://ideas.woocommerce.com/forums/133476-woocommerce/suggestions/3867647-ability-to-apply-coupons-manually-when-manually-ad\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">requested on the WooCommerce ideas board</a> four years ago and had received 374 votes for consideration.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/woocommerce-apply-coupon.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>WooCommerce will now automatically re-calculate the order total after applying the coupon and the same in reverse if a coupon is removed. Although it seems like a small improvement, implementing it without breaking extensions was a fairly complex endeavor for the WooCommerce team.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This was tricky to develop because of the way the cart and coupons were built initially, so some refactoring was needed, but we tried to implement these changes in a backwards compatible manner so extensions wouldn’t require changes,&#8221; WooCommerce lead developer Mike Jolley said.</p>\n<h3>WooCommerce 3.2 Adds Extension Support Version Checks Prior to Core Updates</h3>\n<p>One of the most exciting new features in 3.2 is support for a new plugin header that extension developers can use to specify which versions of WooCommerce have been tested and confirmed to be compatible. This information will be displayed to users in the plugin update screen when future WooCommerce core updates become available.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/woocommerce-extensions-version-checks.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>These warnings save time for store owners by identifying extensions that need further research and testing before applying a core update. It makes it easier for admins to confidently update their installations without having to worry about extensions breaking. After a few more major releases of the plugin, it will be interesting to see how this new system improves updates overall and how other plugins with their own ecosystems of extensions might be able to benefit from something similar.</p>\n<p>Version 3.2 also brings improved accessibility for select boxes, updates to the new store setup wizard, a new “resend” option on the edit order page, and a host of admin UI enhancements that make it easier to manage products and extensions.</p>\n<h3>WooCommerce.com Adds New Subscription Sharing Feature</h3>\n<p>Customers who have purchased extensions from WooCommerce.com can now take advantage of a new <a href=\"https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/managing-woocommerce-com-subscriptions/#section-11\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">subscription sharing feature</a> that allows them to specify additional sites (via WooCommerce.com email address) where they want the extension/key to be active. This is especially useful for agencies, developers, and multisite store owners who can now grant the use of an extension without having to connect their own accounts to client sites. The original purchaser of the extension will be the one billed for the subscription and can revoke access for connected sites at any time.</p>\n<p>WooCommerce 3.2 had <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/compare/3.1.2...3.2.0\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1610 commits</a> from 98 contributors. Currently, 47% of installs are still on 3.1 but that number should go down as store owners start updating to the latest. The WooCommerce team reports that all changes should be backwards compatible with 3.0 and 3.1 sites, but site owners will still want to test their extensions before applying the 3.2 update.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 11 Oct 2017 19:07:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"HeroPress: Queer Woman In Tech … In A Bowtie\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2144\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:120:\"https://heropress.com/essays/queer-woman-tech-bowtie/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=queer-woman-tech-bowtie\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7663:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/101117-min-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: I have found the WordPress Community the most diverse and accepting space for our beautiful, vast array of queer individuals in tech, period.\" /><p>Did you know there are still several states in the US where employers can fire me for being gay?

I have been incredibly lucky to have a career full of supportive companies where I have felt safe and accepted. But I also have another big thing that has helped me for over 13 years: WordPress.</p>\n<h3>A Little History</h3>\n<p>Back when I was in high school in the mid nineties, I was fortunate enough to have access to a computer that connected to this new “internet” thing. This was in 1996 when we had to call the internet. I remember vividly spending nights browsing all these “homepages” of people—even people that were my age—from all over the world. One night I thought, “One day I want to make one of these…” I literally stopped mid thought and decided that I was just going to start right that instant. I signed up for a free Angelfire account using my mom’s email address, and was off and running. Angelfire gave you an advanced option of a code editor, so I copied and pasted and poked and prodded code all summer.</p>\n<blockquote><p>As a result, I taught myself a good chunk of HTML by creating some of the ugliest pages in internet history.</p></blockquote>\n<p>But that started me on a path that I would never look back from. I saw such great potential in connecting with others using this whole “World Wide Web” thing I had just discovered.</p>\n<h3>A Web Log</h3>\n<p>Fast forward some years into college and the dawn of the 2000’s when this crazy idea of sharing a journal on the internet started. Web logs—later termed “blogs”—started popping up left and right. I hopped on board with a blogger.com blog almost exactly 17 years ago (10/19/00), then moved to this blogging platform known as b2 just about a year later. Some may recognize this, because b2 by cafelog was the codebase forked to create the first WordPress. So technically, I’ve been using WordPress since before it was WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Creating Community</h3>\n<p>Back when blogging first became a thing, commenting systems weren’t developed yet, so it was more like just shouting into space wondering if anyone was listening. But people were. Some of us added message boards to our sites.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Conversations happened, connections were made and communities started to form. Some of these connections are still some of my close friends today.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We share a special bond because we all kind of learned the internet together. These created communities also helped me feel less like an outcast and gave me hope that I wasn’t the only one that felt out of place like I did. People’s blogs were vulnerable glimpses into their lives and hardships, really helping me see I was not alone and even helping me face some of my own struggles. Back then I didn’t realize I was gay, but I did feel strangely out of place in so many parts of my life.</p>\n<h3>Coming Out</h3>\n<p>In my late 20’s I finally realized, accepted and came out to myself that I was a lesbian. For many years following I stumbled around a lot to find my true expression and identity. Not to mention shed—and recover from—the many external pressures that were forcing me into a completely fabricated heteronormative “box” that I did not fit. It took well into my 30’s to find my comfort zone as an androgynous/masculine of center expressing, gay woman. With that, my outward expression and style creates a daily “coming out” to everyone I meet… or at the very least, draws attention to me when in midwestern heteronormative spaces. Thus, putting me a bit more at risk of being targeted for being queer.</p>\n<h3>And now back to WordPress</h3>\n<p>Back to the subject at hand, how does all this relate to WordPress? Throughout this whole journey of self discovery, I was continually using and learning WordPress as well. By the time I had come out, I had learned enough about working with WordPress templates to create custom websites. This gave me the tools to create my own job if I ever lost my full time employment, or would find myself in a toxic, unhealthy—or even dangerous—working environment.</p>\n<blockquote><p>WordPress became my ticket to being self sufficient and confident in my career.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On top of it all, I have found the WordPress community the most diverse and accepting space for our beautiful, vast array of queer individuals in tech, period. This made the decision to join in the WordPress community an easy and safe choice. I had not seen many people like me at tech-related events before, let alone speaking at one. But WordCamps have given me the ability to be that gay woman in a bowtie speaking at the front of the room that I had not seen represented before. And that I can do that without fear is priceless! WordPress and this wonderful community has helped me feel more confident in who I am as a web creator, but more importantly, a person.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Queer Woman In Tech &#8230; In A Bowtie\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Queer%20Woman%20In%20Tech%20%26%238230%3B%20In%20A%20Bowtie&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fqueer-woman-tech-bowtie%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Queer Woman In Tech &#8230; In A Bowtie\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fqueer-woman-tech-bowtie%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fqueer-woman-tech-bowtie%2F&title=Queer+Woman+In+Tech+%26%238230%3B+In+A+Bowtie\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Queer Woman In Tech &#8230; In A Bowtie\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/queer-woman-tech-bowtie/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/101117-min-150x150.jpg&description=Queer Woman In Tech ...

HTML mode can be triggered by toggling the ellipsis menu and selecting the HTML icon.

Eventually, they landed on putting the trash icon, the cog settings, and this new HTML mode under an ellipsis.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg testers will also notice that version 1.4 <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2878\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">redesigns the editor&#8217;s header</a>, grouping content actions to the left and post actions to the right.</p>\n<p>This release adds the initial REST API infrastructure for reusable global blocks, an idea Matias Ventura <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/1516\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">proposed</a> several months ago. The <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2503\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pull request</a> was created by new Gutenberg contributor Robert Anderson, a web and mobile developer at Tumblr. It is based on the technical details that Weston Ruter <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/2081\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">outlined</a> for creating dynamic reusable blocks. Anderson highlighted a few examples of what this infrastructure will eventually enable for users:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Convert a block into a reusable block, and give it a name</li>\n<li>Convert a reusable block back into a regular block</li>\n<li>Edit a reusable block within a post and have the changes appear across all posts</li>\n<li>Insert an existing reusable block into a post</li>\n<li>Delete an existing reusable block</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anderson said the next step is adding a core/reusable-block block to the editor that can be rendered and edited, followed by a UI for adding, deleting, attaching, and detaching reusable blocks.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg 1.4 will now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2877\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">show a users&#8217; most frequently used blocks</a> when hovering over the inserter. If the editor doesn&#8217;t have enough usage data, it will display the paragraph and image blocks by default.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-10-at-10.49.18-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Version 1.3 of the plugin introduced <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-1-3-adds-new-feedback-option-for-plugin-testers\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a new feedback option for testers</a> with a link in the Gutenberg sidebar menu.

The company&#8217;s CEO Sid Sijbrandij joined Municheiello with guest hosts, Adam Stacoviak and Jerod Santo from The Changelog podcast, for the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dhjw-TT964\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GitLab live event</a> that aired yesterday.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When we think about investing, we want to be involved in the fastest-growing companies in the world,&#8221; Munichiello said. &#8220;We think about that a little differently than most firms in that we are looking for looking for dev-focused tools. We think software will disrupt the enterprises of the future and so we think the best tools that help enable and empower the best software teams will become enormous companies over time. We&#8217;re certainly seeing that with GitLab.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Munichiello said he favors investing in open source because it is &#8220;the most secure and the best software in the world.&#8221; Although GitLab is a much smaller company than its more prominent rivals GitHub and Bitbucket, it currently dominates the self-hosted Git market with its open source tools. GitLab is used by 100,000 organizations and customers include NASA, the Nasdaq Stock Market, Sony Corp, Comcast, Bayer, among many other large companies.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-10-at-11.50.49-AM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>In addition to the $20 million in funding, the company also announced that it has appointed Matt Mullenweg to its board of directors.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very excited to announce that Matt Mullenweg, the CEO of Automattic and founder of WordPress decided to join our board,&#8221; Sid Sijbrandij said. &#8220;He&#8217;s a leading figure on how to think about open source and how to build a business on that and a remote-only work culture.&#8221; Sijbrandij said GitLab&#8217;s board of directors sets the tone for what the company is allowed to spend its money on, how it approaches the balance between open source and closed source, and the features that the team decides to make money with.</p>\n<p>&#8220;GitLab’s powerful momentum and scaling have a lot of parallels to Automattic and WordPress in their early days,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;WordPress had to battle a lot of competitors, and ultimately came out on top as a successful company on an open source business model. I hope to help GitLab achieve the same triumph. Fundamentally, I want to help create the kind of internet that I want to live in and I want my children to live in, one that reaches a global audience and one that is able to make a difference.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg also said he was impressed with GitLab&#8217;s transparency and how the company shares many of its internal documents, whether it&#8217;s a sales manual or employee onboarding information. GitLab, which employees nearly 200 people, also shares a similar work culture to Automattic, as 100% of the team works remotely.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">“Not only being ahead in terms of transparency, GitLab is exciting for me bc I think distributed work is the future of work.” &#8211;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@photomatt</a> <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f4bb.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/2728.png\" alt=\"✨\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n<p>&mdash; GitLab (@gitlab) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gitlab/status/917441432847376385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 9, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>When asked if there is anything down the line for collaboration between GitLab and WordPress, Mullenweg said, &#8220;It&#8217;s definitely something on our minds. Core WordPress is still Trac and Subversion, so I think that it&#8217;s not our top priority this year, but in the future it&#8217;s definitely on the radar.&#8221;</p>\n<p>GitLab started with basic version control and an issues tracker. Last year  the company announced its first master plan to make GitLab a complete developer solution, which it completed in December 2016. Sijbrandij said the company is aiming to deliver a complete DevOps solution in 2018, a set of tools that unifies the development and operations work into a single user experience.</p>\n<p>GitLab has been working towards the goal of supporting the complete DevOps lifecycle by adding tools for application performance monitoring and server monitoring. This enables developers and operations managers to keep tabs on code after it is deployed, while using a single user interface, the same tools, and one permissions model.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It used to be that development and operations were separate parts in a company and they had their own tools and those tools were different,&#8221; Sijbrandij said. &#8220;You needed different expertise to operate them. Now devops aims to align and integrate those groups. What happens is people took the tools from two different departments and tried to glue them together. They duck taped the tools together. That&#8217;s what you see in traditional devops &#8211; the glue between the traditional developer tools and the traditional operating tools, and it&#8217;s not a very good experience. We want to take the complete set of tooling we have for development and extend it all the way to operations, so it&#8217;s about creating a single application that does both.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Check out the recording of the GitLab live event below for a more in-depth explanation of Sijbrandij&#8217;s vision for creating a complete DevOps solution in 2018.</p>\n<p></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 10 Oct 2017 18:55:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"WPTavern: WordPress 4.9 Adds Scheduling, Drafts, and Front-End Preview Links to the Customizer\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=75276\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:103:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-9-adds-scheduling-drafts-and-front-end-preview-links-to-the-customizer\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2012:\"<p>While <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-8-evans-released-featuring-nearby-wordpress-events-new-media-widgets-and-link-boundaries\">WordPress 4.8</a> focused on adding new widgets, visual improvements to links in the text editor, and a new dashboard widget that displays nearby events, WordPress 4.9 places a heavy emphasis on customization.</p>\n<p>In WordPress 4.9, the Customizer has a new publish button with options to publish, save draft, or schedule changes.

Ventura describes how WordPress has become difficult to customize, as online publishing has embraced rich media and web design has evolved in complexity over the years.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordPress can build incredible sites, yet the usability and clarity that used to be a driving force for its adoption has been fading away,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;The present reality is that many people struggle using WordPress as a tool for expression.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ventura&#8217;s words hint at the growing threats from competitors whose interfaces define users&#8217; current expectations for a front-end editing experience. If WordPress is to stay afloat in a sea of competitors, it can no longer continue expanding its capabilities while leaving a disconnect between what users see while editing in the admin versus what is displayed on the frontend.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordPress has always been about the user experience, and that needs to continue to evolve under newer demands,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;Gutenberg is an attempt at fundamentally addressing those needs, based on the idea of content blocks. It’s an attempt to improve how users interact with their content in a fundamentally visual way, while at the same time giving developers the tools to create more fulfilling experiences for the people they are helping.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ventura elaborated on the foundations of the block approach to content creation and how it will expose more functionality to users in a unified interface, bringing more opportunities to the plugin ecosystem. The post offers some clarity for those who have been wondering about the decision to &#8220;make everything a block.&#8221; Ventura also anticipates that blocks will become a big part of WordPress theming in the future:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Themes can also provide styles for individual blocks, which can, in aggregation, fundamentally alter the visual appearance of the whole site. You can imagine themes becoming more about the presentation of blocks, while the functional parts can be extracted into blocks (which can potentially work across multiple theme variations). Themes can also provide templates for multiple kind of pages—colophon, products, portfolios, etc., by mixing blocks, setting them up as placeholders, and customizing their appearance.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ventura also introduced a few new possibilities that Gutenberg could enable. He shared a video showing how granular control over each block can pave the way for a future where WordPress core allows for real-time collaborative editing. This is a feature that has been painfully lacking from the CMS but is nearer on the horizon with Gutenberg in place.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This same granularity is allowing us to develop a collaborative editing framework where we can lock content being edited by a peer on per block basis, instead of having to lock down the whole post,&#8221; Ventura said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ventura sees Gutenberg as the path to finally bringing front-end editing to WordPress:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Once Gutenberg is capable of handling all the pieces that visually compose a site—with themes providing styles for all the blocks—we end up with an editor that looks exactly like the front-end. (And at that point, we might just call it front-end editing.) Yet we’d had arrived at it through gradually improving the pieces of our familiar ship, in a way that didn’t cause it to collapse or alienated the people aboard. We want to accomplish this in a way that would allow us to refine and correct as we iterate and experience the reality of what is being built and how it is being used.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He likened the challenge of the Gutenberg project to upgrading the materials on a ship while ensuring that it continues to sail. As there are many passengers who depend on the boat, completely breaking it for the purpose of rebuilding is not an acceptable way forward.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is an attempt at improving how users can connect with their site in a visual way, not at removing the flexibility and power that has made WordPress thrive,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;There might be a time when the old ways become obsolete and disappear, absorbed by the richer and clearer interface of blocks, but we are doing as much as possible to make this a process. The old doesn’t have to disappear suddenly, it can be gradually shaped into the new.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Comments are not enabled on the post, but it has received mostly positive feedback on Twitter. For some, it clarifies the direction of Gutenberg, the purpose of blocks and the possibilities they enable. Others in the community are on board with the concepts behind Gutenberg but are not comfortable with the tentative timeline for its inclusion in core. Ventura&#8217;s post does not address many of the more practical concerns the community has about allowing enough time for the WordPress product ecosystem to get ready for Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg has confirmed that <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-addresses-concerns-about-gutenberg-confirms-new-editor-to-ship-with-wordpress-5-0\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg will ship with WordPress 5.0</a> whenever Gutenberg is ready and most recently said that delays on selecting the JavaScript framework &#8220;will likely delay Gutenberg at least a few weeks, and may push the release into next year.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Last week, a post published by Yoast SEO founder Joost de Valk sparked conversation with his proposed <a href=\"https://yoast.com/gutenberg-alternative-approach/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">alternative approach to Gutenberg</a>, which calls for a slower, staged rollout for plugin authors.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In this point of time, it’s not possible for plugins at all to integrate with Gutenberg,&#8221; de Valk said. &#8220;How on earth should plugin authors be able to build their integrations within a few months? That’s not possible. At least not without breaking things.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Gutenberg-2.2-block-level.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>His proposal recommends keeping the idea of blocks and making over the admin for WordPress 5.0 but leaving the meta boxes and toolbar untouched.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are very enthusiastic about the idea of blocks, but have strong concerns about some of the technical choices and the speed of the implementation process,&#8221; de Valk said. &#8220;We are also worried about the lack of priority given to accessibility issues in the project. But most importantly, we are very much concerned about the fact that plugins are not able to integrate with the new editor.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s impossible for developers to have a clear understanding of the right way to extend Gutenberg right now. The JavaScript framework for the plugin has not yet been announced and critical issues regarding how block data should be stored are just now being floated for discussion.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Editor/Gutenberg team would like the broader core group to start thinking about and discussing how block data is stored,&#8221; Ventura proposed during last week&#8217;s core development meeting. &#8220;We currently (specially after allowing meta attributes) have a lot of ways to store block data, with different tradeoffs. It’s going to be important to communicate when each is appropriate. This will come through examples and documentation, but generally such knowledge has also spread by core contributors doing talks and blog posts, etc.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Further collaboration from the broader community of WordPress core contributors should bring the project closer to being able to deliver the documentation developers need in order to follow best practices for extending the new editor. In the meantime, Ventura&#8217;s <a href=\"http://matiasventura.com/post/gutenberg-or-the-ship-of-theseus/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> is a great read for understanding the larger vision behind Gutenberg and where it is headed.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 10 Oct 2017 03:56:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:8:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Thu, 02 Nov 2017 13:45:35 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Thu, 02 Nov 2017 13:30:17 GMT\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:11:\"HIT lax 250\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:4:\"gzip\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20130911030210\";}','no');

But after you’ve created and uploaded a video to your YouTube channel, your job is not done. Far from it! It’s time to measure your efforts. So, let’s open your analytics, and break down the success of your <a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/boost-brand-visibility-youtube.html\">YouTube videos</a>!</p><p><span id=\"more-31014\"></span></p><h2>Target audience</h2><p>By knowing who your target audience is, you’ll be able to create videos that are specifically tailored to their needs. But analyzing these YouTube metrics, it will also tell you if you are reaching the audience you want to reach. There are two essential metrics that you should be paying special attention to: the <strong>demographics</strong>, and the <strong>playback location</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Demographics</h3><p>On YouTube, you can get an in-depth look at who your audience is, by looking under Overview &gt; Demographics &#8212; this way, you’ll be able to look at an analysis of your audience, classified by gender, age, and country location.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31006\" src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/demographics.png\" alt=\"youtube metrics -- demographics\" width=\"940\" height=\"396\" srcset=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/demographics.png 940w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/demographics-300x126.png 300w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/demographics-768x324.png 768w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/demographics-114x48.png 114w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/demographics-793x334.png 793w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/demographics-600x253.png 600w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/demographics-315x133.png 315w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\"/></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>By keeping track of the demographics of your audience, you’ll be able to tailor your content towards your actual audience. The more your video content speaks to your target audience, the better its results will be.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Playback location</h3><p>With the Playback location metric, you’ll be able to see where your videos are being watched &#8212; On the YouTube watch page, on your channel page, embedded in external websites or apps, etc. You can also keep track of the watch times across the various sites that have embedded your video.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31009\" src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/playback.png\" alt=\"playback youtube metrics\" width=\"940\" height=\"546\" srcset=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/playback.png 940w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/playback-300x174.png 300w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/playback-768x446.png 768w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/playback-83x48.png 83w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/playback-575x334.png 575w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/playback-600x349.png 600w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/playback-315x183.png 315w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\"/></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Use these metrics to fully understand where your audience is watching your videos and why; and act accordingly. Knowing where your videos are being watched will help you get to know different types of niches that you didn’t know before and help you create strategic partnerships with sites that have embedded your videos.</p><p>With the data provided by the playback location, you could also reinforce a certain channel that should be getting more views but doesn’t, and overall make more informed and strategic decisions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Audience behavior</h2><p>There is so much more about a view than the view itself. Your audience behaviour helps you keep track of every detail. How well are your videos <strong>retaining your audience</strong>? What is the <strong>average view duration</strong> for your videos, and the <strong>traffic sources</strong> that are leading viewers to your video?</p><p>Let’s take a deeper look at these metrics:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Relative and absolute audience retention</h3><p>The relative audience metric compares your retention to other videos of the same length, showing you how much of your video your viewers are watching. Are they “hitting and quitting” your video content, or watching it all the way through?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31010\" src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/retention.png\" alt=\"audience retention youtube metrics\" width=\"940\" height=\"454\" srcset=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/retention.png 940w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/retention-300x145.png 300w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/retention-768x371.png 768w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/retention-99x48.png 99w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/retention-692x334.png 692w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/retention-600x290.png 600w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/retention-315x152.png 315w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\"/></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You can access this metric in the “Audience Retention Report.” (Overview &gt; Audience Retention).</p><p>The relative audience retention has a twin though, the absolute audience retention. The absolute audience retention metric shows a curve that will tell you the exact percentage of views for every moment of your video. With the absolute metric, you’ll see if your videos have any lower points, and start working to improve them (by removing these lower-attention points, changing them, or the structure of your video).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Average view duration</h3><p>If you access your analytics panel, you’ll find “Watch Time,” a metric that breaks down the amount of time that people spend on your videos and their total views.</p><p>By looking at the watch time, you’ll have the data of the estimated total minutes of viewing time that your audience is spending on each one of your videos. This way, you can keep track of which videos are more interesting and engaging to your audience, and start getting insights on how to get them interested in watching more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Average percentage viewed</h3><p>The average percentage viewed relates to the average view duration, giving you a measure of how well your video is keeping your audience’s attention.</p><p>You can use these metrics to learn how engaged your viewers are along the total duration of the video. By having this information, you can analyze exactly in which part of your video your audience has stopped watching, and why this is happening. If your video is not keeping your audience engaged, you get to analyze if it’s something that happens just in one video or if it’s a repeating thing &#8212; and in this case, what could you do to improve it?</p><p>For example, if your audience stops watching at a certain point of your videos, you could be improving it by modifying your next video’s structure slightly. You could also add a strong call to action in that point of your video, etc.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Traffic sources</h3><p>This report shows the sites and features (on YouTube) that viewers are using to find your content &#8212; for example: are they getting to your content by searching directly on YouTube? Or are they getting to it because of the “Suggested Videos” thumbnails? Are they following external links from other social networking sites?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31012\" src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/traffic.png\" alt=\"traffic sources youtube metrics\" width=\"940\" height=\"529\" srcset=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/traffic.png 940w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/traffic-300x169.png 300w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/traffic-768x432.png 768w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/traffic-85x48.png 85w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/traffic-593x334.png 593w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/traffic-600x338.png 600w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/traffic-315x177.png 315w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\"/></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You can access this metric in the Traffic Sources Report, and there you’ll find the watch time and views from external sources <em>and</em> sources within YouTube. Traffic sources are a very useful metric to track, because understanding where your viewers are coming from will help you understand how to further drive traffic to your videos.</p><p>For example, if your viewers are getting to your videos from external sites or social platforms, you can confirm if the data aligns with data provided by Facebook or other social media sites;  You can also keep track of which external websites are embedding your videos, and if it’s worth it to reach out to them and create an ongoing relationship with them!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Devices</h3><p>When you’re measuring the success of your YouTube videos, it’s extremely important to know which devices your audience is watching your content on. Actually, it’s even more important for videos than for other types of content. Why? Because this will be directly influencing your content creation <em>and</em> your content strategy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31007\" src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/devices.png\" alt=\"devices youtube metrics\" width=\"940\" height=\"227\" srcset=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/devices.png 940w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/devices-300x72.png 300w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/devices-768x185.png 768w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/devices-150x36.png 150w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/devices-600x145.png 600w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/devices-315x76.png 315w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\"/></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You need to think about who’s viewing your videos, and on which device, to understand how you will be creating the videos: the video format, aspect ratio, type of video (there are different types of videos to be used for different contexts), the need of including subtitles for a better understanding of your content, etc.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Audience engagement</h2><p>Now, let’s take a deeper look into your audience engagement. After you’ve seen how your audience behaves when they’re watching your video, it’s time to measure this engagement in depth.</p><p>You can do this by keeping track of your video’s <strong>views</strong>, the<strong> likes and dislikes</strong> it receives, how much it gets <strong>shared </strong>and <strong>commented </strong>on, and your channel’s <strong>subscribers</strong>. Let’s take a look!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Views</h3><p>Views are the most basic way to measure if your videos are being successful or not. In the end, that’s the main goal: that people look at your video.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31013\" src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/views.png\" alt=\"youtube metrics: views\" width=\"744\" height=\"534\" srcset=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/views.png 744w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/views-300x215.png 300w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/views-67x48.png 67w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/views-465x334.png 465w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/views-600x431.png 600w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/views-315x226.png 315w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 744px) 100vw, 744px\"/></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When you open the watch time report, you’ll be looking at the number of legitimate views for your channels or videos. You can also look at the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6096647\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Realtime report</a>, to see the estimated view data for your last 25 published videos.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Likes/Dislikes</h3><p>By measuring your likes and dislikes, you’ll be able to check out which videos had a lot of favorites and which didn’t. This will give you the necessary tools to compare your most liked videos to the rest of them, so you can figure out why your audience likes them.</p><p>Remember to look at this metric by your video’s likes to dislikes ratio, instead of just the numbers, which could be misleading: If video “A” has 100 likes and 50 dislikes, that’s a 2:1 ratio; if video “B” has 800 likes and 200 dislikes, that’s a 4:1 ratio.</p><p>Even though video “B” has more dislikes than video “A”, a 4:1 ratio is better than a 2:1 ratio, and this means that your audience response is better to video “B”.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Shares</h3><p>YouTube lets you see which platforms your videos are being shared on. This will help you make decisions about which platforms might be best for you to focus your video marketing efforts on, and cross-promoting your content.</p><p>By looking at the Shares metric you’ll be able to see which videos are being shared via social media &#8212; And this is really big, because sharing is one of the best forms of engagement you can get from your audience.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31011\" src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/shares.png\" alt=\"shares youtube metric\" width=\"940\" height=\"283\" srcset=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/shares.png 940w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/shares-300x90.png 300w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/shares-768x231.png 768w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/shares-150x45.png 150w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/shares-600x181.png 600w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/shares-315x95.png 315w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\"/></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A share means that your viewer has found your content to be interesting enough to endorse you by sharing it with their network. Likes are good too, but they’re more passive. A share, like a comment, is an active way of engagement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Comments</h3><p>As you’ve read before, comments also rank high on importance when measuring the success of your videos. Keeping track of your comments-to-views ratio is a great way to track your engagement. Just having views is one thing, but a comment shows how much you’ve connected with your viewers.</p><p>On YouTube, you can measure this for individual videos, or for your whole channel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Subscribers</h3><p>You can track your subscribers by looking at their growth over time, just like you would do in any of your social media accounts. But you can also track how many subscribers you’ve gained and lost in a specific period &#8212; if you’re gaining more subscribers than what you’re losing, then you’re on the right track.</p><p>If you happen to gain (or lose) an unusual amount at once, check what you’ve been posting, and check for possible explanations. This way, you’ll know the type of content that will attract subscribers, and the type of content that will scare them away.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Website performance</h2><p>How do your videos influence your website metrics? Let’s take a look at your <strong>website visits</strong> from YouTube, and the <strong>average time on page</strong> and <strong>bounce rate</strong> when the video is embedded.</p><p><strong>  </strong></p><h3>Website visits (from YouTube)</h3><p>Is your video engaging your audience enough that they want to know more about you and your brand, and visit your website? The ultimate goal is to turn those viewers into new customers for your business.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31008\" src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/GoogleAnalytics.png\" alt=\"Use Google Analytics to track YouTube referral traffic\" width=\"940\" height=\"237\" srcset=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/GoogleAnalytics.png 940w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/GoogleAnalytics-300x76.png 300w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/GoogleAnalytics-768x194.png 768w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/GoogleAnalytics-150x38.png 150w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/GoogleAnalytics-600x151.png 600w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/GoogleAnalytics-315x79.png 315w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\"/></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Track the number of visits that your video is attracting. If you find that’s not enough, look closely at <a href=\"http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2017/03/video-content-customer-journey/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">your content</a>: are you adding links to your videos and the description fields for each of your videos? It’s important to paste these links at the very top of the description, so it doesn’t get hidden behind the “show more” section.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Average time on page (when video is embedded)</h3><p>Did you know that the average time on page is <a href=\"https://wistia.com/blog/video-time-on-page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">particularly linked to video content</a>? Having relevant video content on your page increases the value your audience gets from their visits, and keeps them around longer.</p><p>In fact, the more time people spend engaged with your content, the more time they have to familiarize with your brand, potentially acting upon a call to action.</p><p>A great way to take advantage of the retention power of your video content, is to place a call to action right within your videos.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Bounce rate (when video is embedded)</h3><p>A bounce rate measures the number of viewers that stop watching your videos, and go to a different page or website. Sometimes, watching a video that is way too long for its purpose may cause a bounce.</p><p>The average attention span of online users is short, and a general rule of thumb is that your videos shouldn’t be longer than 2-3 minutes. This, of course, may vary depending on your specific content &#8212; so do your research on the optimal length of every type of video.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Conversion rate from YouTube visits</h3><p>If you’re producing product videos, <a href=\"http://go.yumyumvideos.com/blog/what-is-an-explainer-video\">explainer videos</a> or any type of video with the goal of increasing your conversion rate, then keeping track of your conversions metric is a must.</p><p>You’ve got to track the number of leads or customers that you’ve gained thanks to a specific piece of video content, and it’s a number than can be expressed as a percentage of all viewers that convert.</p><p>You can improve your conversion rate by making your video relevant to what your target audience wants to know at every specific stage of the sales funnel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>In summary…</h2><p>There are five types of metrics you should be looking at: your target audience, their behavior and engagement; and your video’s performance in your website.</p><p>By keeping track of all this you’ll be able to create a well-informed video marketing campaign &#8212; specifically, if you’re aware of who your target audience is, how they’re accessing your YouTube videos and why, you’ll have the tools to craft great video content that is tailored specifically for them.</p><p>How are you keeping track of your video’s success? We’re looking forward to reading about it in the comments!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img class=\"pinterest-hidden aligncenter wp-image-31017 size-large\" src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/you-tube-metrics-PIN-min-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"you tube metrics\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/you-tube-metrics-PIN-min-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/you-tube-metrics-PIN-min-200x300.jpg 200w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/you-tube-metrics-PIN-min-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/you-tube-metrics-PIN-min-32x48.jpg 32w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/you-tube-metrics-PIN-min-223x334.jpg 223w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/you-tube-metrics-PIN-min-600x900.jpg 600w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/you-tube-metrics-PIN-min-315x472.jpg 315w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/you-tube-metrics-PIN-min.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\"/></p><div class=\"wp_rp_wrap wp_rp_vertical_m\" ><div class=\"wp_rp_content\"><h3 class=\"related_post_title\">Related posts</h3><ul class=\"related_post wp_rp\"><li data-position=\"0\" data-poid=\"in-29236\" data-post-type=\"none\" ><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/words-dominate-digital-world.html\" class=\"wp_rp_thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/04/words-dominate-min-315x158.png\" alt=\"Do Words Still Dominate the Digital World?\" width=\"315\"/></a><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/words-dominate-digital-world.html\" class=\"wp_rp_title\">Do Words Still Dominate the Digital World?</a></li><li data-position=\"1\" data-poid=\"in-28824\" data-post-type=\"none\" ><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/email-marketing-and-marketing-automation-in-2017-free-report.html\" class=\"wp_rp_thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/04/email-marketing-and-marketing-automation-min-315x158.png\" alt=\"Email Marketing and Marketing Automation in 2017 [Free Report]\" width=\"315\"/></a><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/email-marketing-and-marketing-automation-in-2017-free-report.html\" class=\"wp_rp_title\">Email Marketing and Marketing Automation in 2017 [Free Report]</a></li></ul></div></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/youtube-metrics.html\">Essential Metrics to Measure Your YouTube Videos</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com\">GetResponse Blog - Online Marketing Tips</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"https://blog.getresponse.com/youtube-metrics.html/feed\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"            \";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"Is it Too Soon to Start Thinking About Your Christmas Campaign?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"https://blog.getresponse.com/soon-start-thinking-christmas-campaign.html\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://blog.getresponse.com/soon-start-thinking-christmas-campaign.html#respond\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 30 Oct 2017 14:33:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"MARKETING\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"https://blog.getresponse.com/?p=31000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:631:\"<p>With summer already behind us, and the weather already taking a decidedly autumnal turn, thoughts are now turning towards the upcoming holiday seasons.

But while All Hallows Eve has only gained popularity outside its homeland of the USA in relatively recent times, there’s another holiday on the not-too-distant horizon for which excitement never wobbles or wanes.</p><p>Christmas.</p><p><span id=\"more-31000\"></span></p><p>With UK consumer spending hitting dizzying heights again in December <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/december-consumer-spending-is-looking-like-a-win-for-retailers-2016-12?IR=T\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2016</a>, despite the economic downturn, Christmas is an opportunity never to be squandered by marketers everywhere. Businesses in almost every industry see Christmas as a time to make up for any quieter periods they may have experienced over the year, with some completely relying on the season for survival.</p><p>So, is it too soon to start planning your Christmas marketing campaign already?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>No, it isn’t…</h2><p>While some like to leave their Christmas shopping until the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-38182127\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">last minute</a>, there are a lot of consumers who are at their most well-planned and conscientious during the build-up to the festive season. Indeed, many people like to spread their shopping out over the few months up to December, which means, even if you, personally, haven’t started thinking about Christmas yet, there’s a good chance a large portion of you customer base has.</p><p>However, it’s still considered early doors yet for a lot of people, and so you don’t want to come on too strong with the Christmas branding while it’s still October – lest you incur much tutting and cries of ‘Ridiculous!’ from those who don’t want to hear about it until December. However, you still shouldn’t let that prevent you from starting the roll-out of ideas.</p><p>You could even embrace the fact it’s ‘too early’ to start thinking about Christmas and, in doing so, cause your customers to start thinking about Christmas. Early. Your next newsletter could contain a slightly tongue-in-cheek reference by saying something along the lines of, “We realise it’s only October, but…” This will stand a good chance of pre-empting any tutting, and get your customers on-board to any Christmas-related suggestions you may have.</p><p>Maybe you could start a Chrimbo-oriented competition? When you send out your next newsletter, offer all your subscribers the chance to be entered in a prize draw each time they make a purchase between now and Christmas Eve. The more purchases they make, the more entries they get. Make the prize something festive, such as a Christmas hamper.</p><p>The great thing about a competition like this is it’s not too aggressive with the Christmas message – it just gently reminds customers the silly season is only a few months away.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Festive branding</h2><p>Big service industry brands such as <a href=\"http://www.countdowntoredcups.com/menu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Starbucks</a> have become well-known for their Christmas branding, and there’s nothing to stop you from thinking about how you could do the same.</p><p>If you have a brick-and-mortar shop, why not dedicate a corner somewhere to just a few Christmas related items – just as a soft-sell reminder to customers that Christmas is coming. With early festive marketing, the focus is very much on being subtle, and just slowly introducing the idea of Christmas to your customers. Be too forceful, and you run the risk of putting consumers off.</p><p>It could be you don’t wish to actively start promoting Christmas-related ideas yet, and that’s fine. However, don’t be fooled into thinking this means you can put your feet up and relax.</p><p>You still want to be ready for when the time <em>does</em> come to shift your marketing into Christmas mode. And this means planning.</p><p>It could be you want to create some Christmassy videos to help promote your business over the holiday season. If you’ve not done it before, you’ll be surprised at how much time it can take to produce a professional-quality <a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/a-crash-course-in-video-marketing-for-small-and-medium-sized-businesses.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">promotional video</a>. You need to plan it out, write a script, film the video, edit the footage, add music and/or graphics, and more before it’s ready to share with your audience.</p><p>Maybe you want to create a social media advent calendar, which gives your customers a new incentive each day of December in the run up to the 25<sup>th</sup>?

Once you have a strong consumer base you can benefit from referrals and existing brand recognition, and decrease the budget.</p><p>Research on your <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveolenski/2015/12/21/a-practical-guide-to-determining-your-perfect-marketing-budget/#7191cfb360d8\">specific industry</a> can also give some insight. Best practices for a B2C company are going to vary from B2B. Any information you can find about trends in your individual market is valuable insight.</p><h2><strong> </strong></h2><h2>Distributing funds properly</h2><p>What worked in marketing 5 years ago is not what works in marketing today. So before you determine allocation of your funds, do some research. <strong>Which categories are the smartest to invest in?</strong>  For example, digital ads <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Digital-Ad-Spending-Surpass-TV-Next-Year/1013671\">keep on growing</a>, and in 2017 are projected to surpass traditional TV advertising spend <strong>for the first time. </strong>Social media ads are an easy and inexpensive way to start off in this sphere. An active social presence itself doesn’t even cost money &#8211; only time to post content and interact with users.</p><p>Another major category today is <a href=\"https://trackmaven.com/blog/marketing-spending-trends-2017/\">automation.</a> Whether it’s a social media/<a href=\"https://www.getresponse.com/features/email-marketing.html\">email</a> platform, analytics tracking that auto-populate reports, or customer relation managers with built in follow-up options, <strong>automation saves you time. </strong>It streamlines processes and allows you to focus on future thinking instead of being caught up in day-to-day repetitiveness.</p><p>Something that has survived the digital test of time is search engine optimization. The growth of mobile may have changed the way people search &#8211; <strong>but it’s a still powerful form of lead generation. </strong>Budgeting in this category could look like Google pay per click/other inside forms of SEO, or even hiring a consultant to improve your current practices and improve your Google rank.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-30981\" src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/budgeting.png\" alt=\"creating a marketing budget\" width=\"975\" height=\"594\" srcset=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/budgeting.png 975w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/budgeting-300x183.png 300w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/budgeting-768x468.png 768w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/budgeting-79x48.png 79w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/budgeting-548x334.png 548w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/budgeting-600x366.png 600w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/budgeting-315x192.png 315w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px\"/></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A budget doesn’t have to be carved in stone. All the research in the world can’t tell you how your personal audience will respond. Something that worked for someone else in you industry&#8230;might not work for you. You may find yourself redistributing funds halfway through the year. But carefully surveying your analytics and following industry best practices can point you in the right direction. <strong>A strategy for smart marketing is a strategy for success.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img class=\"pinterest-hidden aligncenter wp-image-30985 size-large\" src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/marketing-budget-PIN-min-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"how to determine the perfect marketing budget\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/marketing-budget-PIN-min-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/marketing-budget-PIN-min-200x300.jpg 200w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/marketing-budget-PIN-min-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/marketing-budget-PIN-min-32x48.jpg 32w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/marketing-budget-PIN-min-223x334.jpg 223w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/marketing-budget-PIN-min-600x900.jpg 600w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/marketing-budget-PIN-min-315x472.jpg 315w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/marketing-budget-PIN-min.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\"/></p><div class=\"wp_rp_wrap wp_rp_vertical_m\" ><div class=\"wp_rp_content\"><h3 class=\"related_post_title\">Related posts</h3><ul class=\"related_post wp_rp\"><li data-position=\"0\" data-poid=\"in-28824\" data-post-type=\"none\" ><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/email-marketing-and-marketing-automation-in-2017-free-report.html\" class=\"wp_rp_thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/04/email-marketing-and-marketing-automation-min-315x158.png\" alt=\"Email Marketing and Marketing Automation in 2017 [Free Report]\" width=\"315\"/></a><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/email-marketing-and-marketing-automation-in-2017-free-report.html\" class=\"wp_rp_title\">Email Marketing and Marketing Automation in 2017 [Free Report]</a></li><li data-position=\"1\" data-poid=\"in-29228\" data-post-type=\"none\" ><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/email-marketing-and-beyond.html\" class=\"wp_rp_thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/04/kath-pay-webinar-recap-min-315x158.png\" alt=\"Email Marketing and Beyond: Global Industry Benchmarks [Webinar Recap]\" width=\"315\"/></a><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/email-marketing-and-beyond.html\" class=\"wp_rp_title\">Email Marketing and Beyond: Global Industry Benchmarks [Webinar Recap]</a></li></ul></div></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/determine-perfect-marketing-budget.html\">How to Determine the Perfect Marketing Budget</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com\">GetResponse Blog -

The generation gaps are now more defined by the fast advances in technology.  Millennials are usually assumed to have a sense of entitlement. They have the world at their fingertips with smartphones, Wi-Fi, and the doting of their baby boomer parents. Hence, one has to market to such individuals accordingly.</p><p>Below are a few marketing tips for this particular generation:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span id=\"more-30968\"></span></p><h2>1. Focus on texts and subject lines</h2><p>Millennials, who are mostly eighteen to thirty-five, prefer the text method of communication. The shorter the version, the more likely they are to read a memo or any sort of message. After the SMS formats or a short WhatsApp message, Millennials are most likely to read an e-mail. However, this is only if they like the subject line. In fact, they may <a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/writing-email-subject-lines.html\">only read the subject line</a> and respond based on that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>2. Cut down on phone calls</h2><p>Videos may be a good marketing strategy, but phone calls are a big no-no. Even if they are automated, Millennials are most likely to ignore the call or cut it off.</p><p>The days when a telemarketer would call up numbers from a list are over when one is dealing with Millennials. This particular group actually regards phone calls as an invasion of privacy. Most of them can relate to someone panicking if they receive an actual phone call even from a friend.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>3. Connection with traditionalists</h2><p>A strange but true fact is that Millennials are <a href=\"http://elitedaily.com/life/the-20-differences-between-the-baby-boomers-and-generation-y/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">most likely to connect</a> with the group born before generation X. this means that a youngish person is more responsive towards an elderly male or female. The least connection is between Generation X and Millennials. Hence, in order to get the most out of a spokesperson or salesperson for Millennials, one needs to hire either a Millennial or a traditionalist.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>4. Show, don’t tell!</h2><p>If your marketing strategy or product requires telling a story, don’t say it in a block of text. A whole lot of information is conveyed much more effectively to Millennials if it is presented in a <a href=\"https://www.impactbnd.com/blog/millennials-love-video-marketing-you-should-too-infographic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">video</a>, infographic, or pictures. The more interesting the video; with music, colors, and memorable characters, the more effective it would be.</p><p>Since Millennials sense a connection with traditionalists, an effective strategy would be to include such individuals in strategic planning.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>5. Provide a ‘safe’ platform for communication</h2><p>Since Millennials has problems with face-to-face and even phonetic conversation, a call to action in a Facebook video, for example, should never have a phone number. Simply put, Millennials need options where they can hide behind a screen.</p><p>However, Millennials are open to meeting in real life if they feel comfortable and motivated enough. Social groups on Facebook are now making quite a wave, with people trusting each other enough to arrange a huge get together in reality.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Wrapping up…</h2><p>The key to marketing is understanding your consumer base. Some may find it a pain to cater to Millennials in terms of marketing and other areas, but such is the need of the day. This generation does have a lot of buying power when all is said and done.</p><p>Additionally, each generation operates and communicates differently. The sooner a marketer understands this and strives to make decisions based on proper information, the better.</p><p>Once one gets the hang of marketing for Millennials, it’s really not so difficult. The setup for Generation X might be difficult to change from, but every company is going into online marketing anyway. Hence, one can focus on online and content marketing for Millennials and the older marketing methods for Generation X.</p><p><img class=\"pinterest-hidden aligncenter wp-image-30971 size-large\" src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/millennial-marketing-PIN-min-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"marketing to millennials\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/millennial-marketing-PIN-min-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/millennial-marketing-PIN-min-200x300.jpg 200w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/millennial-marketing-PIN-min-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/millennial-marketing-PIN-min-32x48.jpg 32w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/millennial-marketing-PIN-min-223x334.jpg 223w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/millennial-marketing-PIN-min-600x900.jpg 600w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/millennial-marketing-PIN-min-315x472.jpg 315w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/millennial-marketing-PIN-min.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\"/></p><div class=\"wp_rp_wrap wp_rp_vertical_m\" ><div class=\"wp_rp_content\"><h3 class=\"related_post_title\">Related posts</h3><ul class=\"related_post wp_rp\"><li data-position=\"0\" data-poid=\"in-29013\" data-post-type=\"none\" ><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/ai-helps-not-replaces-content-marketers.html\" class=\"wp_rp_thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/04/AI-helps-min-315x158.png\" alt=\"How AI Helps, Not Replaces, Content Marketers\" width=\"315\"/></a><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/ai-helps-not-replaces-content-marketers.html\" class=\"wp_rp_title\">How AI Helps, Not Replaces, Content Marketers</a></li><li data-position=\"1\" data-poid=\"in-29338\" data-post-type=\"none\" ><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/social-customer-service-trends.html\" class=\"wp_rp_thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/05/social-customer-service-min-315x158.jpg\" alt=\"Social Customer Service Trends to Watch\" width=\"315\"/></a><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/social-customer-service-trends.html\" class=\"wp_rp_title\">Social Customer Service Trends to Watch</a></li></ul></div></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/marketing-tips-attract-millennials.html\">5 Expert Marketing Tips To Attract Millennials</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com\">GetResponse Blog - Online Marketing Tips</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://blog.getresponse.com/marketing-tips-attract-millennials.html/feed\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"            \";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"4 Reasons Why You Need CRM for Your Business\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://blog.getresponse.com/4-reasons-crm-business.html\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"https://blog.getresponse.com/4-reasons-crm-business.html#respond\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 19 Oct 2017 23:37:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"PLATFORM\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"https://blog.getresponse.com/?p=30959\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:633:\"<p>When you start a business, you’ll encounter a dizzying array of acronyms: ROI, SEM, CPC, PPC, OR, CTR, LTV and many more.

But on the other hand, it’s yet another tool you need to learn, implement and manage. So you’re probably thinking, is it really worth it?</p><p>Absolutely. And here are the top 4 reasons why your business – whatever its size, age or industry – needs a CRM.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>1. Keeps your data in one place</h2><p>In sales, speed and simplicity are essential. Spending precious time searching through your inbox or call history to get a prospect’s number – or see when you last got in touch – is a huge waste of time. It’s also unreliable. If you forget a touchpoint, you risk sending the same email multiple times, which can annoy your prospect.</p><p>A CRM gives you a full, accurate record of your entire interaction history with prospects. And it’s all accessible with one click. So you won’t have to manually reconstruct a timeline of touchpoints, because it’s all visible and easy to access in the deal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-30957\" src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/sarabarker.png\" alt=\"crm tools\" width=\"944\" height=\"356\" srcset=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/sarabarker.png 944w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/sarabarker-300x113.png 300w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/sarabarker-768x290.png 768w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/sarabarker-127x48.png 127w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/sarabarker-886x334.png 886w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/sarabarker-600x226.png 600w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/sarabarker-315x119.png 315w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 944px) 100vw, 944px\"/></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You can also use a CRM to see the sales pipeline and opportunity queue. That way, you always know if you’re on track to reach your sales quotas or goals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>2. Connects the entire organization</h2><p>CRM also improves communication across your business. What if a rep is working a lead their colleague spoke to a year ago? What if they don’t know they’re taking over a team member’s territory – and are working from an indecipherable Excel spreadsheet of prospects?</p><p>All these problems are solved with a CRM. Reps can immediately see what’s already been done with a given prospect – and the next steps. So they don’t need to reach out to their colleagues to get interaction history, because the information they need is already in the system. CRM saves time, and keeps everyone up to speed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>3. Makes your life easier</h2><p>CRM also standardizes how you and your colleagues track activities and prospect interactions, which streamlines reporting.</p><p>Without one, salespeople will track activities in different ways. This makes it hard for managers and leaders to piece together data.  Because CRM makes data entry uniform, managers can easily combine and analyze data to get a big picture view of the organisation in real time.</p><p>Consistent recording can also keep your sales team happier. They can easily see when leads are reassigned, and have a clear and complete picture of prospects as they move through the queue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>4. Sustainable, scalable tool for growth</h2><p>“Can’t I just do this all in an Excel spreadsheet and call it a day?” you might be asking.</p><p>If you only have a handful of customers, you could manually track each interaction. But look ahead to one, two or even five years from now. I imagine you’ll want to make more sales and grow your database. Soon your salespeople will have to spend much more time recording prospect and customer information. And if you’re still doing everything yourself, 24 hours still might not be enough to do it all – and do it well!</p><p>Also, do you want to analyze your sales activities to see which outreach strategies or touchpoints work best? It can take a lot of time to pull inconsistently tracked data from different sources – and it might not give you a true picture.</p><p>It all comes down to one question: do you want to grow your business? If so, you’ll need to pinpoint the best times to contact your prospects and give them relevant info. A CRM is the simplest, most effective way to do just that.</p><p>Best of all, the GetResponse CRM is now fully integrated with email marketing. That means you can easily communicate with your contacts – and get a helicopter view of your sales and marketing efforts in one place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Over to you</h2><p>Thinking about using CRM?

How do you treat your customers after they purchase from you? Leverage the customers you <em>have</em> to get the customers you <em>want.</em></p><p>Take a step back for a second. When was the last time you examined your marketplace as if you were a prospect or customer? When did you last time you surfed the web like your <a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/retain-customers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">customers</a> do?  That’s a short (15 minute) but important experiment for you. You can start to see things in the marketplace that you may want to change in your own business. These changes would make it clear that you are a differentiated service provider. Start by reading the About Us pages of your competitors’ websites. You’ll see a lot of the same things. How to stand out from the rest? Start <em>showing</em> your customers how you’re different.</p><p>How is your experience different?

It is a series of post-purchase encounters designed to deliver intense and eager enjoyment, interest, or approval. If you were to look at the customer journey, you’ll see that it’s more of a loop, not linear like a sales funnel.

You can write a standard copy: the highest washing quality, the best price, a back to school promo, buy now! But wait! In advertising everything has to be a story now, so why not sell the washing powder using the power of storytelling?</p><p><span id=\"more-30934\"></span></p><p>Here&#8217;s the basic template. ”Meet Kate. Kate desperately wanted to wash her clothes but couldn&#8217;t. That is until the off voice told her about this new washing powder. Now Kate&#8217;s clothes are clean and she&#8217;s happy!” Do we have a story? Yes. Is it poor? Incredibly poor. Why? Two reasons.</p><p>An ad revolves around a product. The story&#8217;s central point is the protagonist. But we have Kate in the above example. So why doesn&#8217;t it work? Well, in order for the audience to root for the hero, we need to be aware of a couple of things. First, <strong>a hero needs a goal</strong>. She needs to want something, crave for a change. Do we have a goal in our story? Well, sort of. There&#8217;s one very important thing missing from it.</p><p><strong>A stake</strong>. We need to know why the protagonist&#8217;s craving is so important. In an ideal story, it&#8217;s the matter of life and death. Of course, we don&#8217;t have to treat it liter- ally every time but consider this: Kate met a guy yesterday, he is everything she&#8217;s ever dreamt of. And he invited her on a date today! But she&#8217;s just landed in a foreign city after two weeks of hiking, and all she has is a bag full of dirty clothes. Now her desire for the clean clothes is more interesting. Because it&#8217;s no longer about the laundry — it&#8217;s about Kate winning the love of her life. Most of the corporate storylines already have a protagonist (“Our CEO opened the new production line” or ”Wesley became the newest member of our product team”) but <strong>fail to emphasize the importance of the goal they try to achieve</strong>. Fix this one thing and your stories will be better. But there is more to it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Do you know how do you engage your curiosity? I just did.</h2><p>When Emma Coats tweeted the <a href=\"http://pixar-animation.weebly.com/pixars-rules.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pixar&#8217;s Rules of Storytelling</a>, many asked: which one is the most important of them? My vote goes to this one:</p><blockquote><p><em>You admire a character for trying more than for their successes.</em></p></blockquote><p>The harder your character tries to succeed, the harder the audience roots for him. Now let&#8217;s get back to Kate&#8217;s story. There&#8217;s no trying at all there! The same goes for most of the corporate storylines: a CEO opened the new production line. Wesley became the newest member of our team. How do you make your character try? Use the second rule of good storytelling:</p><blockquote><p><em>What is your character good at? What is he comfortable with? Throw the polar opposite at them.</em></p></blockquote><p>If the salesperson is good at winning new clients, a story about her winning a new client is no story at all. Have the CEO (a nerdy tech genius with a social anxiety) go to the sales meeting and see how she copes. It makes for a much better story, right?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>A structure to rule them all</h2><p>A book titled <em>Culture And Narration</em> appeared in 1976. Its authors, Edmund Leach and Algirdas Greimas, researched the structures of folk tales. They came up with a story structure: six elements each story should have. What can we find there?</p><ul><li><strong>The hero.</strong> Your typical story protagonist: Kate from the story above, our nerdy CEO or Wesley, the newest member of our team.</li><li><strong>The goal.</strong> Most of the stories have them. Good stories emphasize the stakes. So the CEO needs to open the new production line or the company goes bankrupt. Kate needs her clean clothes so she can win the love of her life. You get it.</li></ul><p>But this is where things get interesting. How do you throw your protagonist in a situation he clearly does not want to be in? You add two elements to your story.</p><ul><li><strong>The giver</strong> is someone (or something) who throws our protagonists out of their comfort zones. For Kate, it&#8217;s her two-week hiking. The nerdy CEO has to go to a sales meeting because of the nasty flu that&#8217;s decimating his team.</li><li><strong>The receiver</strong>. You can come up with a very fancy reason for your protagonist to abandon his comfort zone, but your audience still needs to believe it. This is where the receiver comes in. Why would our character agree on doing something completely out of character? What would trigger them? Kate does it in the name of love. And what about our CEO?</li></ul><p>If you got the previous ones right, you still have two more to go. These are about your story&#8217;s turning point.</p><ul><li><strong>The enemy</strong>. In classic fairy tales, it&#8217;s the dragon. In Kate&#8217;s story, it&#8217;s her dirty laundry. For our CEO it&#8217;s his social anxiety. The better you depict the enemy, the more emotional your audience will get. You need the protagonist to fall.</li><li><strong>The help(er)</strong>. Another character or a magical artifact that comes to the rescue. Our hero can be helped directly (think Sam carrying Frodo in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>) or he can have something called the a-ha moment (like when Rafiki talks Simba into going back in <em>The Lion King</em>).You can recognize this structure in fairy tales, movies or advertising. But many of these stories feel&#8230; schematic. Why? Because they&#8217;re based on the same template? Well&#8230; Here comes the best part.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>A template for a template?</h2><p>Most of the advertising or PR copy that is written using the story structure follows the basic template: Your customer is the protagonist and the product is the help(er). You can squeeze a fairly decent story out of it (by giving your protagonist an unusual goal or a surprising motivation), but the audience will know (sooner rather than later) what you are trying to achieve.</p><p>You should know that there are three more meta-templates (the templates for using the story structure template) that you can use. And they&#8217;re not that obvious.</p><ul><li>The product and the customer are the helpers. Someone important for the customer is the hero. Just look at the brilliant execution of this template below:</li></ul><p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YdZMypElBpo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The seller is the protagonist, the customer is the helper and the prod- uct&#8230; is the enemy! A boy sells his engagement ring on eBay. He does not want to have it because the girl said no. You&#8217;ll help him&#8230; by buying the ring!</li><li>The product is the hero! Think of a lamp that just wants to be useful. Or furniture that craves for some warmth from the butts of a loving family&#8230;</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/I07xDdFMdgw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Next time you&#8217;ll want to build your story, think of the above set of tools. Then disregard the first thing that comes to your mind. Get rid of the second and third thing, too. Now you can start telling your story.</p><p><img class=\"pinterest-hidden aligncenter wp-image-30939 size-large\" src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/storytelling-meta-template-PIN-min-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"The power of a storytelling meta-template\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/storytelling-meta-template-PIN-min-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/storytelling-meta-template-PIN-min-200x300.jpg 200w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/storytelling-meta-template-PIN-min-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/storytelling-meta-template-PIN-min-32x48.jpg 32w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/storytelling-meta-template-PIN-min-223x334.jpg 223w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/storytelling-meta-template-PIN-min-600x900.jpg 600w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/storytelling-meta-template-PIN-min-315x472.jpg 315w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/storytelling-meta-template-PIN-min.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\"/></p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\"wp_rp_wrap wp_rp_vertical_m\" ><div class=\"wp_rp_content\"><h3 class=\"related_post_title\">Related posts</h3><ul class=\"related_post wp_rp\"><li data-position=\"0\" data-poid=\"in-29424\" data-post-type=\"none\" ><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/remain-authentic-with-instagram-automation.html\" class=\"wp_rp_thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/05/authentic-with-instagram-automation-min-315x158.png\" alt=\"How to Remain Authentic With Instagram Automation\" width=\"315\"/></a><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/remain-authentic-with-instagram-automation.html\" class=\"wp_rp_title\">How to Remain Authentic With Instagram Automation</a></li><li data-position=\"1\" data-poid=\"in-29346\" data-post-type=\"none\" ><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/facebook-lead-ads-zapier.html\" class=\"wp_rp_thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/05/FACEBOOK-lead-ads-min-315x158.png\" alt=\"How to Automate Your Lead Gen with Facebook Lead Ads and Zapier\" width=\"315\"/></a><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/facebook-lead-ads-zapier.html\" class=\"wp_rp_title\">How to Automate Your Lead Gen with Facebook Lead Ads and Zapier</a></li></ul></div></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/storytelling-meta-template-powerful.html\">Why is a Storytelling Meta-Template Powerful?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com\">GetResponse Blog - Online Marketing Tips</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"https://blog.getresponse.com/storytelling-meta-template-powerful.html/feed\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"            \";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"Close More Deals by Using These 5 Traditional Sales Techniques\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"https://blog.getresponse.com/traditional-sales-techniques.html\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"https://blog.getresponse.com/traditional-sales-techniques.html#respond\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 11 Oct 2017 16:34:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"AUTOMATION\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"https://blog.getresponse.com/?p=30918\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:604:\"<p>Marketing automation is a very powerful tool.

It can generate leads for your business, it can warm the doorknob for your salespeople, and it can help you close more deals. But in the end, <a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/sales-use-marketing-automation-drive-revenue.html\">marketing automation is not a stand alone tool</a>. In other words, you can’t just set it and forget it. You have to help things along.  With that in mind, here are 5 traditional sales techniques to keep in mind when your marketing automation campaign starts delivering the leads you’re looking for.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span id=\"more-30918\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Don’t start by talking about your company, your product, or your services</h2><p>I know that sounds counter-intuitive, but it’s one of the most powerful techniques you can use. After all, what is it that most people are interested in? Are they most interested in you? Absolutely not. They’re most interested in <em>themselves</em>. So, with that in mind, you should talk about <em>their</em> company and their needs, not about <em>your</em> company or your needs.</p><p>Ultimately, your goal is to discover your prospect’s pain point so that you can show that your product or service is a good solution for them. Which leads us to our next tip.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Don’t assume that the prospect knows what the actual problem is</h2><p>In many cases, your prospect will talk about the symptom they have rather than the real problem. Here’s a case in point. A friend of mine who is a consultant was pulled in to solve a productivity problem at a manufacturing plant. “Our assembly line needs to run faster in order to get more product out the door, but we can’t afford to upgrade the machinery, so we’re stuck in a bind,” they said.</p><p>But it turned out the problem wasn’t with the machinery, it was with a fax machine which was located 200 yards from the guy who processed the orders. Walking the 200 yards every hour to get the orders slowed production down significantly.</p><p>$50 and a new fax machine later, the company increased efficiencies by 5% which contributed $7.5 million to their bottom line.</p><p>Which brings us back to the main point – don’t assume that what the prospect thinks is the problem is the actual problem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Practice the 70/30 rule</h2><p>Many people who are in sales have that job because they’re very friendly. Friendly often translates into being talkative, but talking too much can be a hindrance if you’re a sales person. When you talk too much, you can come across as someone who is nervous or insecure about what it is you’re selling.</p><p>A general rule of thumb is to do about 30% of the talking while your prospect does about 70%. That ratio allows you to listen for their pain points and then to respond to what it is that <em>they</em> need (not what you need).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Use your 30% wisely</h2><p>If you’re going to practice the <a href=\"http://hansengroupcompany.com/the-7030-rule-of-communication/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">70/30 rule</a>, you’re going to have to use your 30% wisely. After all, you won’t have much time to speak if your prospect is doing most of the talking.</p><p>What should you do with your 30% of the time? Don’t do a sales pitch. Instead, ask questions. In other words, do what your doctor does when you go in for an exam – he or she will ask a series of questions that helps them zero-in on what your actual health problem is. When you ask questions of your prospect, you’re zeroing-in on what their problem is, which will ultimately lead you to a solution (that you happen to be selling at a very reasonable price, by the way).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Recognize that person-to-person marketing is your most powerful tool</h2><p>In the end, people buy from people they like. No amount of slick brochures or fancy internet videos will sell your product or service if people don’t feel warm and comfortable around you.</p><p>How can you make people feel warm and comfortable? As mentioned already, talk about them. Take an interest in their desires and needs. Find commonalities with them. And be genuine – most people can sniff out when someone is turning on the charm just to close a deal, so be sure to take a genuine interest in your prospect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>A final tip</h2><p>Here’s a bonus tip for you – be polite to other salespeople. When they email you or call you, they’re just trying to make a living and feed their family, so be respectful to them. After all, what goes around comes around – if you’re nice to other people, then other people will be nice to you.</p><p><img class=\"pinterest-hidden aligncenter wp-image-30930 size-large\" src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/count_pin-683x1024.png\" alt=\"traditional sales techniques\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/count_pin-683x1024.png 683w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/count_pin-200x300.png 200w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/count_pin-720x1080.png 720w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/count_pin-32x48.png 32w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/count_pin-223x334.png 223w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/count_pin-600x900.png 600w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/count_pin-315x472.png 315w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/count_pin.png 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\"/></p><div class=\"wp_rp_wrap wp_rp_vertical_m\" ><div class=\"wp_rp_content\"><h3 class=\"related_post_title\">Related posts</h3><ul class=\"related_post wp_rp\"><li data-position=\"0\" data-poid=\"in-28972\" data-post-type=\"none\" ><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/customer-segmentation.html\" class=\"wp_rp_thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/04/customer-segmentation-min-315x158.png\" alt=\"Customer Segmentation: The Ideal Compromise\" width=\"315\"/></a><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/customer-segmentation.html\" class=\"wp_rp_title\">Customer Segmentation: The Ideal Compromise</a></li><li data-position=\"1\" data-poid=\"in-29018\" data-post-type=\"none\" ><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/questions-about-marketing-automation.html\" class=\"wp_rp_thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/04/questions-about-marketing-automation-min-315x158.png\" alt=\"The 5 Most Frequently Asked Questions About Marketing Automation\" width=\"315\"/></a><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/questions-about-marketing-automation.html\" class=\"wp_rp_title\">The 5 Most Frequently Asked Questions About Marketing Automation</a></li></ul></div></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/traditional-sales-techniques.html\">Close More Deals by Using These 5 Traditional Sales Techniques</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com\">GetResponse Blog - Online Marketing Tips</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://blog.getresponse.com/traditional-sales-techniques.html/feed\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"            \";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"11 Ways to Increase Your Email Open Rate\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://blog.getresponse.com/increase-email-open-rate.html\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"https://blog.getresponse.com/increase-email-open-rate.html#respond\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 10 Oct 2017 20:33:53 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"MARKETING\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"https://blog.getresponse.com/?p=30904\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:594:\"<p>For subscribers to click through your email, they first need to open your email.

I’ll be the first to admit that my inbox currently has over 1,700 unopened emails. Some of those are automated emails from services I signed up for and some of them are emails from well-meaning people who didn’t catch my interest. Whatever the case, each one represents someone who tried and failed to get in contact with me.</p><p><span id=\"more-30904\"></span></p><p>Now, maybe you’re not like me. Maybe you open all of your emails regardless of if you’re interested, simply so you can lower that “unread emails” number.</p><p>Surely, some of your email subscribers do this. But what I want to discuss is how to get people to open your email because they’re interested in what you have to say, not because they are checking something off their list.</p><p>Here’s 11 ways to catch your reader’s interest before they open your email.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>1. Spend more time on the subject line.</h2><p>You’ve probably heard this one before. But it’s still the single most important part of any <a href=\"https://www.getresponse.com/features/email-marketing.html\">email marketing</a> message that you write.</p><p>The second thing that your subscribers are going to look at is the subject line (right after the “from” name). The subject line is the heart of determining if someone is going to open your email.</p><p>Sadly, most of us don’t spend nearly enough time on the subject line.</p><p>To improve the quality of your subject lines, create a list of 20 different options. Read through them and pick your top 10. Read through them again and pick your top 5. Read through them one more time and pick your top 3. Then, show the top 3 to a few other people and get their opinion before choosing a winner.</p><p>For your reference, here are some <a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/8-email-subject-lines-to-increase-your-open-rate.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">amazing subject lines</a> that you should totally steal:</p><ul><li>[Exclusive Content] Here are all your eBooks!</li><li>David, did you know that…?</li><li>We have finally done it, David!</li><li>[Free Tools] Download the tools we promised you.</li></ul><p>Your subject line needs to trigger one of two things in the receiver.</p><ul><li>Curiosity. Ex: David, did you know that…?</li></ul><p>Or&#8230;</p><ul><li>Self-interest. Ex: [Free Tools] Download the tools we promised you.</li></ul><p>Spend some time thinking through your subject line and you’ll get a better open-rate. Even things like the<a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/email-subject-lines-specific-short.html\"> length of your subject</a> line matter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>2. Create a compelling preheader.</h2><p>Sadly, the preheader of an email is often neglected. But the reality is that before opening an email and after reading your subject line, there’s a good chance that people are going to read your preheader.</p><p>It’s the final barrier between an email sent and an email opened.</p><p>Think of your preheader the way you think about the tagline title of a book. The title (subject line) intrigues you, but it’s the tagline (preheader) that gets even more specific and compelling.</p><p>Here are some book titles that would make great subject line/preheader combos:</p><ul><li>Contagious: Why Things Catch On.</li><li>Grit: The Power Of Passion And Perseverance.</li></ul><p>Write a prepheader that goes into more detail than your subject line, drawing subscribers to open your email. It’s not just where they look, it’s why they click.</p><p><em>Note: Keep in mind that if you have an image at the top of your email, the alt text is what will show first. Luckily, you can just strategically craft alt text for the top image that makes for an awesome and compelling preheader.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>3. Create a swipe file.</h2><p>This is the best piece of advice you’ll get out of this article.</p><p>And it’s dead simple.</p><p>Ready?</p><p>Create an email folder to collect all the emails you receive that had exceptional subject lines and preheaders. This is called a swipe file. It’s a personal library of amazing emails so that when you’re crafting your own, you have an idea bank to reference.</p><p>Remember, the best copywriters steal from other great writers. You should steal too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>4. Segment your list.</h2><p>You’ve probably heard of list segmentation.</p><p>Segmentation is putting your list of email subscribers into categories based upon their behaviors. If, for example, a pool of people on your email list haven’t opened the past 10 emails, you might put them into a segmentation meant to save them from inactivity. If another pool of people are opening and clicking through nearly every email, they might go into a segmentation meant to upsell.</p><p>In other words, the emails that people on your list receive are behaviorally specific to each person.</p><p>Depending upon the tool you’re using for email marketing, segmenting your list will or will not be an option.</p><p>But if you’re serious about increasing your open rate, it’s a necessary step.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>5. Don&#8217;t get caught in spam.</h2><p>Obviously, it’s practically impossible for people to open your email if it’s going into spam.</p><p>Spam filters are intended to help people avoid inboxes filled with shoddy emails. But sometimes, email campaigns with the best intentions get caught.</p><p>What gives?</p><p>I’ll tell you what. Here’s a list of the things you need to do to avoid that garbage chute.</p><ul><li>Don’t use any cute tricks, trying to cover up the unsubscribe button or putting “Re:” or “Fwd:” in the subject line. These mischievous actions are practically guaranteed to land you in the spam folder.</li><li>Always include appropriate alt text on your images.</li><li>Include an address and from name in your email.</li></ul><p>And here’s the big one:</p><ul><li>Test <strong>everything</strong>.</li></ul><p>Want to know if your email is going to go to spam? Simply send a test email to yourself and a few friends and ask them where it went. If it does go to spam, adjust what you think might have caused it and try again. There’s nothing better than knowing for sure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>6. Choose the best email marketing tool.</h2><p>There are pros and cons to every email marketing tool. Some get caught in spam easier than others. Some allow for segmentation and a/b testing. Others don’t.</p><p>All of these factors play into the potential open rate you can achieve. Using an email marketing tool that fits your brand personality and has the features you need is vital to increasing your open rate.</p><p><a href=\"https://secure.getresponse.com/pricing/en?_ga=2.164388991.192025342.1502905153-1437414281.1499975164\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Getresponse</a> has an email marketing tool that is absolutely phenomenal. For a more extensive list of your options, check out this in-depth <a href=\"https://websitesetup.org/email-marketing-services/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">piece</a> by Robert Mening where he reviews the pros and cons of a plethora of email marketing services (he even reviews Getresponse).</p><p>Ultimately, choose the tool that works for you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>7. Resend campaigns to inactive subscribers.</h2><p>By way of a reminder to subscribers who didn’t open your email, resend the campaign the following day.</p><p>We all lead busy lives and sometimes increasing the open rate of an email is simply a matter of reminding people that they received it in the first place.</p><p>Obviously, you have to walk a fine line with this.</p><p>Resend too many campaigns and you risk increasing your unsubscribe count. Never resend and you’re missing out on a portion of your audience that simply keeps forgetting to open your email.</p><p>Generally speaking, follow these rules:</p><ul><li>Only resend email campaigns a full day after the original was delivered. No sooner. No later.</li><li>Only resend each campaign a max of one time.</li><li>Consider only re-sending campaigns that you consider vital for your audience to see — meaning you don’t resend just your everyday newsletter.</li><li>When you do resend, change the subject line to something more compelling. Something like, “You just missed this…” or “I really don’t want you to miss out on this.”</li></ul><p>Resend your campaigns, but don’t overdo it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>8. Find the ideal frequency.</h2><p>Email your list too much and your open-rate will plummet. Email them too little and they’ll forget you exist.</p><p>Unfortunately, finding the perfect email frequency is easier said than done.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Because that “perfect” frequency varies from list to list. It varies based on what your subscribers expect from you, how they think about you, and the quality of your emails.</p><p>This goes without saying, but make sure to find the correlation between open rate and email frequency. This will help inform you of the appropriate frequency for your list.</p><p>Additionally, here are a few ways to use the appropriate frequency based on your list segmentations:</p><ul><li>Decrease email frequency for people who rarely open your emails.</li><li>Increase email frequency for people who open most of your emails.</li><li>Create a <a href=\"https://www.getresponse.com/features/online-surveys.html\">survey</a> and ask your list how often they wish to receive your emails. Then place each subscriber in an appropriate segmentation.</li></ul><p>Find the sweet spot for your list and your open-rate will automatically increase.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>9. Find the best time of day.</h2><p>Much of email marketing comes down to timing.</p><p>The best time of day to email, depending on your audience, is mostly the same across the board.</p><p>If you have an audience of Nurses who work night shifts, then the optimal email time might change. But according to GetResponse study, generally, the <a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/whats-best-time-day-send-email.html\">best time to send email to your list</a> is on the weekend at around 6 a.m.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div id=\"attachment_30906\" style=\"width: 478px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-30906 size-full\" src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/opensbyday.jpg\" alt=\"Email open rate by day\" width=\"468\" height=\"359\" srcset=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/opensbyday.jpg 468w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/opensbyday-300x230.jpg 300w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/opensbyday-63x48.jpg 63w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/opensbyday-435x334.jpg 435w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/opensbyday-315x242.jpg 315w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px\"/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Email open rate by day</p></div><div id=\"attachment_30907\" style=\"width: 478px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-30907 size-full\" src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/opensbyhour.jpg\" alt=\"Email open rate by hour\" width=\"468\" height=\"363\" srcset=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/opensbyhour.jpg 468w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/opensbyhour-300x233.jpg 300w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/opensbyhour-62x48.jpg 62w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/opensbyhour-431x334.jpg 431w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/opensbyhour-315x244.jpg 315w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px\"/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Email open rate by hour</p></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This makes sense because most people are less busy on the weekends and pay more attention to their email. Send when people are most likely to open your emails or you’re doing yourself and your subscribers a disservice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>10. Optimize for mobile.</h2><p>Most email marketing services and templates come with built in responsivity.</p><p>But if yours doesn’t, you’re making a huge mistake. <a href=\"http://marketingland.com/majority-emails-opened-apple-devices-android-users-pay-attention-115945\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">66% of all emails</a> are opened on smartphones or tablets, meaning that if your email campaigns aren’t mobile responsive, your poor list of subscribers is receiving stuff that looks like this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-30905\" src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/mobile.jpg\" alt=\"email open rate on mobile\" width=\"285\" height=\"560\" srcset=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/mobile.jpg 285w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/mobile-153x300.jpg 153w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/mobile-24x48.jpg 24w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/mobile-170x334.jpg 170w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px\"/></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nothing turns off subscribers like lazy email campaigns. And sadly, that’s exactly how an email like the above example feels.</p><p>A few points to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>Use small file sizes. Everything runs slower on mobile and a slow load time is sure to get an immediate bounce.</li><li>Resize images to make sure everything fits in the mobile screen.</li><li>Make CTA’s a little bigger than they used to be. Small CTA’s are harder to click on phones.</li><li>Make sure to use mobile responsive email templates.</li></ul><p>Mobile responsive emails are a must for anyone who’s serious about their email campaigns.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>11. Use a real person&#8217;s name in the &#8220;from&#8221; field.</h2><p>I thought I’d finish with an easy one.</p><p>Instead of using your business name in the “from” field, use the name of an actual person. Maybe it’s you. Maybe it’s your customer support person. Whatever the case, use a real person’s name.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.superoffice.com/blog/email-open-rates/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">67% of subscribers</a> open an email simply because of who the email is from.</p><p>Using a real person’s name creates the sense that you’re not a robot, but you’re a human being with wants, desires, and personality. Often times, it’s that personality that people connect with. And once they do, they’ll keep opening your emails simply because they like you.</p><p>Tell them who you are in the “from” field and they’re more likely to open your emails.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Test Everything…</h2><p>I could give you hundreds of tips and best practices that promise to increase your email open rate. And while many of them are good, you know your list better than anyone.</p><p>The best thing you can do is <a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/9-creative-ideas-for-simple-email-split-tests.html\">test everything</a>.

Yet this simple gesture stopped me in my tracks because it was so rare — a face-to-face interaction between an email marketer and a subscriber.</span></p><p><span id=\"more-30895\"></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.getresponse.com/features/marketing-automation.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Marketing automation</a> software has </span><a href=\"http://bit.ly/2y9IRtp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">changed the game</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and worked wonders on our ability to stay in touch with a global customer base on ways that are more timely, consistent, and engaging than ever before. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet it’s also made it easy for us to start thinking of our subscribers more as data merge fields than as real people.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Email marketing has changed the conversation</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we have a B2C encounter face-to-face, it’s simple to get a conversation going. Before I was handed that notebook, the owner had also asked me how I’d heard about the store, if I’d been there before, and what I was looking for. It was easy and pleasant to answer her questions as I browsed. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But email is different. While few people would straight up ignore questions being asked of them in person, try sending customers a survey with same inquiries and you might expect anywhere between a </span><a href=\"http://customerthink.com/customer-satisfaction-survey-response-rates-update/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5 &#8211; 15 percent response rate</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — not exactly a great representation of your group. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, consciously or not, people have a tendency to </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/09/everybody-lies-how-google-reveals-darkest-secrets-seth-stephens-davidowitz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lie on surveys</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Reacting to false that feedback could send marketers down an entirely wrong path. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Data bridges the gap</h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But beyond speed and scope, email automation has another advantage over in-person interactions — <a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/beyond-demographics-subscriber-data.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">data</a>. Data tells the story that people can’t or won’t tell themselves. It tells us who our subscribers are, what they need, and how we can serve them. However before you can get those answers, you have to ask the right questions. Here are eight questions you should be asking about your email subscribers and answering with data. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>1. What are their names?</h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s much easier to get someone to fill out a single email field than it is to ask for more information. Yet it’s worthwhile to test asking for at least a first name at sign-up. Personalized emails draw the eye and deliver six-times higher transaction rates.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>2. Do they know what they signed up for?</h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can be tempting to use a contest or other workaround to gather subscribers. But more than likely, you’ll see massive disengagement once you start to send emails. Worse yet, if your subscribers don’t understand what they signed up for, they may flag you as spam hurting your campaigns overall. No matter how you sign up subscribers, send an auto-responder immediately afterwards. This gives unwitting sign-ups the chance to opt out and begins to build a strong relationship with people who want to be there. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>3. Where did they find me?</h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking of getting subscribers onto your list, it’s critical that you understand the path your subscribers took to get to you — and not just the page of your site they signed up on. How did they get to that page? Was it an organic search, a referral link, social media? And what pages did they click on before signing up? Following your users’ paths will help you answer the next question …</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>4. What is their problem?</h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most consumers don’t come to product site looking to make a purchase, they come looking for a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">solution</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The distinction is important because the former assumes that consumers want what you’re selling while the latter defines that they still need to be convinced. Mapping your subscribers’ journey to your sign-up page as well as closely monitoring their engagement behaviors will help you understand what challenges they have so you can convince them your product or service is the solution.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>5. Where are they reading your email?</h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the end of next year, </span><a href=\"http://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Mobile-Statistics-Report-2014-2018-Executive-Summary.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">81 percent of email users</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are expected to access their accounts on mobile. These numbers can vary based on who your audience is and when they are opening your emails so it’s important to check your data, optimize for all screens, and test for a variety of devices before sending.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>6. When are they reading your email?</h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can do a Google search turning up any number of data points about the best days and times to send email. But the truth is, the best time to send email is when </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">your </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">subscribers are reading it. If your subscribers tend to be in the same industry or geographic area, there may be times that are uniquely suited to their needs. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teachers, for example, may check email very early in the morning before students arrive then not again until later in the day. Office workers may be bombarded with a full inbox on Mondays, and emails sent on that day can get lost. Testing is key. Think about your audience then test different days and times to see what works.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>7. Can they see my email?</h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you aren’t asking this question, you might be spending hours designing a beautiful HTML email that few people can see. Check your HTML emails for accessibility by adding alt text to your images and using both button and text links. Mix styles up on occasion — while most subscribers report that they prefer HTML emails, plain text actually gets </span><a href=\"https://zapier.com/learn/email-marketing/email-marketing-mistakes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">higher open rates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, clean your lists. If a group of subscribers on your list is repeatedly unresponsive, continuing to email them could cause some email providers to start marking your emails as spam for all subscribers. Regularly check who isn’t opening and segment that group off your main list into a special reengagement list. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>8. What would they do if I …</h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the most important question you can ask about your email subscribers, and it’s the one that data answers best. Testing — different segments, content, subject lines, frequency, send date, and so on — is the key to any successful long-term email strategy. So don’t be afraid to ask those big what ifs, take a chance, then let the data tell the story.</span></p><p><img class=\"pinterest-hidden aligncenter wp-image-30898 size-large\" src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/questions-email-subscribersPIN-min-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"8 Questions You Should Be Asking About Your Email Subscribers\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/questions-email-subscribersPIN-min-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/questions-email-subscribersPIN-min-200x300.jpg 200w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/questions-email-subscribersPIN-min-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/questions-email-subscribersPIN-min-32x48.jpg 32w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/questions-email-subscribersPIN-min-223x334.jpg 223w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/questions-email-subscribersPIN-min-600x900.jpg 600w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/questions-email-subscribersPIN-min-315x472.jpg 315w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/questions-email-subscribersPIN-min.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\"/></p><div class=\"wp_rp_wrap wp_rp_vertical_m\" ><div class=\"wp_rp_content\"><h3 class=\"related_post_title\">Related posts</h3><ul class=\"related_post wp_rp\"><li data-position=\"0\" data-poid=\"in-29369\" data-post-type=\"none\" ><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/using-google-analytics.html\" class=\"wp_rp_thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/05/googleanalytics-min-315x158.png\" alt=\"7 Important Lessons for Using Google Analytics After Scaling Upwards\" width=\"315\"/></a><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/using-google-analytics.html\" class=\"wp_rp_title\">7 Important Lessons for Using Google Analytics After Scaling Upwards</a></li><li data-position=\"1\" data-poid=\"in-29355\" data-post-type=\"none\" ><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/marketing-automation-goals.html\" class=\"wp_rp_thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/05/marketing-automation-goals-min-315x158.png\" alt=\"Setting the Goals for Your Marketing Automation Program\" width=\"315\"/></a><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/marketing-automation-goals.html\" class=\"wp_rp_title\">Setting the Goals for Your Marketing Automation Program</a></li></ul></div></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/questions-asking-email-subscribers.html\">8 Questions You Should Be Asking About Your Email Subscribers</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com\">GetResponse Blog - Online Marketing Tips</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://blog.getresponse.com/questions-asking-email-subscribers.html/feed\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"            \";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"10 Actionable Social Video Stats\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"https://blog.getresponse.com/10-actionable-social-video-stats.html\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"https://blog.getresponse.com/10-actionable-social-video-stats.html#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 05 Oct 2017 13:37:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"MARKETING\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"https://blog.getresponse.com/?p=30855\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:593:\"<p>We’re long past the time when video content was just the future of online marketing; the future is here and it’s bright.

Video content is a meaningful part of the conversation, and brands that don’t leverage its power can get left behind really quickly.</p><p>But you don’t have to believe me. Let’s look at the facts: how is video content shaping social media interactions, and how can you act on that?</p><p>We’re going to look at ten statistics about social video and what you can do to make the most of them. Let’s start!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>85% of Facebook videos are watched without sound</strong></h2><p>The majority of Facebook audiences watch video without sound. This is because Facebook has built an environment in which there’s no need for the users to turn up the sound &#8212; but this doesn’t mean that consumers are less engaged!</p><p>In fact, brand lift doesn’t get affected by whether the user watches the video with or without sound, as long as you stay up to date and act towards your users habits; news feeds are now full of short videos that feature text or captions. The idea is to <a href=\"http://go.yumyumvideos.com/blog/how-to-optimize-your-explainer-videos-for-facebook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">optimize your videos for Facebook</a>: make it easy for people to consume the information without needing to turn the sound on.</p><p>So, take this into consideration, and always add subtitles to your videos on Facebook! Otherwise, it could just get lost between the 8 billion videos that get uploaded to Facebook each day.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>65% of people who watch the first three seconds of a Facebook video will watch for at least 10 seconds, and 45% will watch for 30 seconds</strong></h2><p>It seems impossible to keep your audience’s attention, doesn’t it? So, nobody is shocked to learn that 10-30 seconds is all the attention you’ll get. But the job of an online marketer is to integrate this fact into your strategy.</p><p>This is why your Facebook videos <a href=\"http://tubularinsights.com/optimal-video-length-youtube-facebook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shouldn’t be longer than a minute.</a> Users like videos that they can quickly like or share before scrolling down to the next piece of content!</p><p>Also, keep the most important information at the beginning of the video. Your message must reach your audience, even if they just stay for the first 10 seconds of it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>93% of Twitter videos are watched on mobile</h2><p>Videos are a powerful addition to the way your brand positions itself on Twitter. This is a social platform that has a majority of mobile users, so there’s no surprise that 93% of Twitter videos are watched on mobile devices. How can you take advantage of this?</p><p>Optimize your videos for mobile usage. This means, for example, using vertical videos. Vertical videos cater to your mobile users because you’ll be maximizing the viewing area in their mobile devices, without them having to rotate their screens.</p><p>Short and to the point is also important, given the ephemeral idiosyncrasy of Twitter’s timeline. And the subtitle and caption rule works here too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Videos are 6X more likely to be retweeted than photos and 3X more likely than GIFs</strong></h2><p>Video is a type of content that spreads widely online, and that’s especially true on Twitter.</p><p>Twitter users like to engage with video content, as it’s the most shared media type in that platform. Not all kinds of videos get the best results anyway. To make sure that your video content will work, the best move you can make is to use native videos.</p><p>Native videos on Twitter will get you the most retweets and interaction. In fact, let’s take a  look at another <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/marketing/en_us/a/2015/new-research-twitter-users-love-to-watch-discover-and-engage-with-video.html\">statistic</a> which says exactly that&#8230;</p><ul><li>According to a study led by Twitter, native videos drive 2.5X replies, 2.8X retweets, and 1.9X more favorites than third-party players</li></ul><p>You see? This is because native videos provide the advantage of autoplay, and also because these videos become part of your media library, so they are easier to find for your audience.</p><p>Keep in mind that <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/2015/new-research-twitter-users-love-to-watch-discover-and-engage-with-video\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">native Twitter videos</a> can be anywhere from one to 140 seconds long, and videos less than 6.5 seconds long will loop automatically.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Despite more brands posting videos than ever before (13.2% of all posts), photos still see higher average engagement (at least on the timeline).</strong></h2><p>This statistic applies for Instagram, so let’s reflect on that for a minute. Instagram started being a platform used just for sharing pictures, and it’s just been fairly recently that they’ve rolled out new features involving video.</p><p>So, the trick with videos on Instagram is to use it in a smart way&#8211; the type of video content with the highest engagement rate is the one that creates a collective experience.</p><p>What does this mean? Top videos on Instagram are the ones that let the audience relive thrilling moments, or get an inside-look at things they wouldn’t normally see, like a behind-the-scenes take. To get the higher engagement, you can (and should!) use video on Instagram, but you should use it as a way to enhance your regular content.</p><p>Facebook, on the other hand…</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>A Facebook video receives, on average, 135% more organic reach than a Facebook photo</strong></h2><p>Facebook video is one of the best ways to get your content out there (on this social network, and reach your audience effectively in this social network. Why? Because Facebook used to rely on photos so heavily, that it’s a type of content that’s almost taken for granted &#8212; and if your audience takes your content for granted, they won’t be paying attention. An overused type of content won’t be effective.</p><p>Video, on the other hand, is where the real growth point is. This format is far more effective at reaching audiences, so be sure to include them into your Facebook strategy and follow some of the tips we mentioned above.</p><p>In fact, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2844852/facebook-will-be-mostly-video-in-5-years-zuckerberg-says.html\">Facebook will probably be all video by 2019</a>!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Facebook Live Videos are watched 3x longer than regular videos</strong></h2><p>On another note, we’ve got Facebook Live Videos. By taking a look at this stat, all of us can definitely agree that Facebook Live videos are powerful.</p><p>This is a type of content that’s actually considered like a different type of media than regular videos. In fact, Facebook usually <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/digital/facebooks-news-feed-algorithm-now-gives-preference-live-video-169947/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ranks Live Videos higher in the newsfeed</a>, because they’re, of course, more interesting and engaging in the moment than after it has passed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Facebook users comment 10X more on Live Videos than they do on regular videos</strong></h2><p>Not only are Facebook Live videos watched 3x longer than regular videos, but also Facebook users comment 10X more on Live videos than they do on regular videos so they should have an important place in your social media strategy.</p><p>Facebook Live videos are great for many purposes, like product launches, in which you get to build up expectations to the maximum before releasing a new product.</p><p>Also, customer interaction &#8212; starting a conversation with your audience is easy with Facebook Live, because of its instant comment feature. You could also use them with a behind-the-scenes approach, or for customer tutorials… The possibilities are endless.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>YouTube has over a billion users, with hundreds of millions of hours watched daily and billions of views</strong></h2><p>Never underestimate the power of using YouTube as a “home base” for your video content! You should manage your YouTube channel wisely, and upload  great quality videos often.</p><p>Don’t forget to link your channel to your other media profiles! Remember, YouTube reaches more viewers in the 18 to 49-year-old demographic than any cable network in the US. Don’t lose the chance to attract these viewers to the rest of your content across different platforms.</p><p><a href=\"http://go.yumyumvideos.com/blog/how-to-rank-youtube-videos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ranking high on YouTube</a> searches is great to take advantage of the high traffic YouTube gets. And it’s not impossible to be the first result in a search!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>In Summary…</strong></h1><p><strong> </strong></p><p>Social video content is here to stay, and it’s time to jump on the bandwagon (if you haven’t done so already!).</p><p>It&#8217;s important to have high-quality video content. One that caters specifically to each of your social media platforms.</p><p>Look at the statistics, and learn about them &#8212; Using native video will always work better. Also, your videos must be optimized for mobile (because most of your audience will be looking from there!). And take advantage of the new, different features, like Live Videos!</p><p>What works better for your brand?

Silly question, I know. Who doesn’t have cravings for chocolate bars? Bear with me for a second, though. When that craving hits, and you’re standing in front of a vending machine or the counter at a gas station, trying to figure out <em>which</em> chocolate bar you want, do you ever feel overwhelmed by the sheer amount of choice? Twix? Kit Kat? Snickers? Dare I say, <em>all three</em>? How’s a hungry chocolate lover supposed to decide? Sometimes, our increasingly mobile world feels similar to the chocolate bar craving scenario.</p><p><span id=\"more-30842\"></span></p><p>Pull out your phone when you’re at the kitchen table, on a bus or even at work, and you’ve got any number of distractions at your disposal.</p><p>Play one of the 30 games you’ve downloaded? Check email? Cruise your Facebook and Twitter feeds? Watch a cat video on YouTube? Take a picture and post to Instagram? Call a friend? (Wait, do people still do that?…just kidding!)</p><p>Having this many options seems like an exaggeration, but we all know the reality is there are way more distractions on your phone than only the ones mentioned.</p><p>And we haven’t even mentioned tablets, laptops, video games or TV yet…</p><p>For marketers and marketing teams – who need to work <em>with</em> technology but equally need to avoid getting distracted by it – the struggle is real. Imagine handling chocolate all day and trying not to eat it. A marketer’s job is pretty much the same thing. Minus the chocolate and the eating, of course.</p><p>It’s vital for busy marketers and marketing teams to efficiently stay up-to-date with an industry that’s in-flux every single day. With our rapidly evolving world in mind (and now also chocolate), here are three tips to help marketers embrace mobile technology without getting distracted.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><h2>1. Use different technologies and devices.</h2><p>Like it or not, part of the modern marketer’s job is that of a technologist. The fact is marketers can’t do their job correctly if they don’t understand, or can’t use various technologies. Marketing <em>is</em> digital, and <a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/ai-helps-not-replaces-content-marketers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">I’ve argued before that the term “digital marketing” is redundant</a>.</p><p>The hardest part about marketing these days is that technologies are always changing. It’s a tough enough job keeping up with what’s already available to us, not to mention considering whatever is on the horizon next.</p><p>And to make it even more confusing, customers use different phones, tablets, and browsers, which means you can’t stay within the comfortable confines of the operating system you like best.</p><p>The more technologies, devices, and platforms you’re familiar with, the better you’ll understand your customers. And as any great marketer would tell you, knowing your customers and their likes, dislikes and tendencies is key to long-term success.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>2. Put yourself in the customer&#8217;s shoes.</h2><p>When using technology for work related research – as I outlined above – a good rule of thumb for remaining productive is to think like <em>you are the customer</em>. Put yourself right in the customer’s shoes and mirror their actions and experiences in using technology to engage with your brand’s digital properties.</p><p>The moment you find yourself laughing at an outrageous GIF, chasing whatever is trending on Twitter or anything other than what your customers would do, try to get back on track.</p><p>Remember, potential customers are usually doing one of the following:</p><ul><li>Looking for information on a topic your brand is knowledgeable about</li><li>Looking for information on your products and services</li><li>Trying to get in touch with you for support</li><li>Purchasing your product or service</li></ul><p>The most important fact about all of these actions is a customer can accomplish them on a phone, tablet, or computer. Your job as a marketer is to test any scenario you can think of, and then double check it on every platform.</p><p>Not only must the customer experience on each singular device run smoothly, but customers should have the ability to transition between devices without interruption.</p><p>It’s a lot, but it’s crucial that your brand keeps up with the ebb and flow of technology’s influence on the business world. The next time you get distracted by technology while acting as a would-be customer, just remind yourself how critical a seamless experience is to your brand’s bottom line.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>3. Plan to adapt.</h2><p>The ability to adjust to the evolving conditions of our technology driven world is one of the most important skills a marketer can have. Every day, technology changes the world, which then impacts how customers interact with the digital environment. By the time these changes are parsed by marketers, not only is the work they’ve just finished been compromised, but the next evolution is already underway.</p><p>There are only two ways to keep up: build room for adaptation into your projects or predict the changes. I prefer leaving room to pivot and adapt to new information, simply because when you make a prediction and act on it, you’re in a lot of trouble if you’re wrong.</p><p>Sometimes though, <a href=\"https://www.wsiworld.com/blog/forecasting-2017-and-beyond-5-marketing-predictions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">you just have to pull out your crystal ball</a> and go out on a limb!</p><p>If you’re aware of how fast technology is driving the world forward, you’ll have a leg up on your competition. Even if you’re wrong, or you struggle to adapt on the fly, the fact that you’ve got an eye on the digital horizon is a great start.</p><p>What are some of the ways you embrace mobile technology without getting distracted? Do you make a point of using different devices and platforms, or do you rely on data to relate to customers? Leave a note if you have any other tips for marketers or marketing teams!</p><p><img class=\"pinterest-hidden aligncenter wp-image-30849 size-large\" src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/mobile-technologyPIN-min-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"embrace mobile technology without distraction\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/mobile-technologyPIN-min-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/mobile-technologyPIN-min-200x300.jpg 200w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/mobile-technologyPIN-min-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/mobile-technologyPIN-min-32x48.jpg 32w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/mobile-technologyPIN-min-223x334.jpg 223w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/mobile-technologyPIN-min-600x900.jpg 600w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/mobile-technologyPIN-min-315x472.jpg 315w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/mobile-technologyPIN-min.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\"/></p><div class=\"wp_rp_wrap wp_rp_vertical_m\" ><div class=\"wp_rp_content\"><h3 class=\"related_post_title\">Related posts</h3><ul class=\"related_post wp_rp\"><li data-position=\"0\" data-poid=\"in-29471\" data-post-type=\"none\" ><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/lead-scoring-lessons.html\" class=\"wp_rp_thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/05/card-counting-min-315x158.png\" alt=\"Lead Scoring Lessons from a Card Counter\" width=\"315\"/></a><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/lead-scoring-lessons.html\" class=\"wp_rp_title\">Lead Scoring Lessons from a Card Counter</a></li><li data-position=\"1\" data-poid=\"in-29295\" data-post-type=\"none\" ><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/businesses-live-stream.html\" class=\"wp_rp_thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/05/Livestreaming-min-315x158.png\" alt=\"6 Reasons Why Businesses Should Live Stream For Better Income\" width=\"315\"/></a><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/businesses-live-stream.html\" class=\"wp_rp_title\">6 Reasons Why Businesses Should Live Stream For Better Income</a></li></ul></div></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/embracing-mobile-technology.html\">3 Tips for Embracing Mobile Technology Without Distraction</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com\">GetResponse Blog - Online Marketing Tips</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"https://blog.getresponse.com/embracing-mobile-technology.html/feed\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"            \";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"Are Your Pop-ups and Overlays Pushing Away Potential Customers?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"https://blog.getresponse.com/pop-ups-overlays-pushing-away-potential-customers.html\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"https://blog.getresponse.com/pop-ups-overlays-pushing-away-potential-customers.html#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 02 Oct 2017 19:29:45 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"MARKETING\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"https://blog.getresponse.com/?p=30832\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:645:\"<p>People hate being interrupted.

Whether they are in the middle of a sentence or in the midst of their favorite TV show, nobody enjoys being interrupted. Yet, it’s become a fairly common practice on some websites to interrupt people while they are browsing. This happens when a site has a pop-up or overlay that covers either part of or the entire page. This, in turn, forces a visitor to click something to make the interruption go away so they can return to reading whatever content they actually wanted or resume whatever they were doing.</p><p><span id=\"more-30832\"></span></p><p>Before we delve in, this isn’t a blatant condemning of overlays and <a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/4-ways-make-pop-ups-less-annoying-effective.html\">pop-ups</a>. They have a place and time on websites where they can be extremely useful. What this article will cover, though, are some of the worst practices and best practices for using them for your site.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Ruining your first impression</h2><p>Visitors bouncing away from a website is already a problem that plagues many a business. It just takes a singular distraction or annoyance and people will leave a site. A site has to capture their visitor’s attention right away and not let it go for a single second, or risk losing them.</p><p>Yet, so many sites think that within the first few minutes, or even seconds, of being on their site, that they need to have a pop-up or overlay <a href=\"http://marketingland.com/stop-interruptions-marketing-age-always-consumer-133401\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">interrupt their experience</a>. All people want to do is start or continue enjoying your content, but instead they have to now deal with your ad, typically for something they aren’t interested in.</p><p>It can be especially frustrating if the overlay slowly crawls down to cover the whole page, or forces you to take additional steps to make it go away. This not only pushes people off a site, it can also leave negative impressions of a website. <a href=\"https://blog.kissmetrics.com/9-user-experience-pitfalls/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don’t repel your visitors</a> with a jarring and obnoxious overlay.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>How to fix it</h3><p>Instead of having the overlay show up within a first few minutes and interrupting a visitor, give them time to enjoy your content. If somebody is going to bounce away in the first minute anyways, your overlay and pop-up isn’t going to be what keeps them. Instead, set your overlay to pop up after long enough for your visitors to enjoy your content or after they have scrolled down to a specific point on your page.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>The same overlay on every page</h2><p>It a pretty common goal, especially on a business’ website, to keep your visitors on your site as long as possible. You want them to move from page to page, moving down your marketing funnel and eventually making a purchase.</p><p>Yet, if your overlay happens on every single page, it becomes annoying. That constant interruption as a visitor tries to make it through your content is aggravating. Not only does that ruin impressions, it could lead to consumers not making a purchase with you, just because they are upset with the constant overlays.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>How to fix it</h3><p>Set up your site and overlays to not occur for people going to multiple pages on your site. If you have the capabilities, try to avoid giving the same offer over and over. Have multiple overlay offers that could work for different people, and try to match up the right offer to each persona you have.</p><p>If you must have multiple overlays on pages, it would also be beneficial to match up the overlay to what is happening on the page. For example, if a person is on a product or sales page, it’s likely they aren’t interested in your mid-funnel e-book. Instead, have an overlay or pop-up talking about your free demo or trial period for your product. <a href=\"https://blog.kissmetrics.com/highly-effective-overlays/\">Strong overlays</a> give a specific offer your visitor wants, related to what page they were on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Chat support</h2><p>Having the ability to chat directly with a representative from a business is one wonderful addition to doing business online. It’s an instant tool to get answers to questions and concerns, and many websites benefit from having a chat box popping up on their site. Not only is it smart to address issues immediately, <a href=\"https://www.digitalrdm.com/why-every-website-should-have-live-chat-to-help-brand-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">it builds your brand as a business</a> who has great customer service.</p><p>It’s just important to know which pages can benefit from having a chat support box opening up on, and which ones it’s just a distraction on — especially if your chat box automatically opens and several messages are sent, possibly including notification sounds with each message. An unnecessary distraction at the wrong time can lead to losing your visitors.</p><p>It can also be annoying if that voice chat opens on every page you go to, even if it’s all part of the same session. These little annoyances can lead to people moving on from your site and finding another site with a more friendly UX.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>How to fix it</h3><p>Look through your analytics and see if you can determine what pages people are looking at when they interact with your chat. If there is a very low amount of chat support requests on things like blog articles or specific pages, maybe don’t have notifications for the chat go off on those pages. On the other side, if there are pages that result in a much higher use of the chat function, be sure your pop up is very visible without becoming obnoxious.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>The last ditch effort</h2><p>Another common use for overlays is that when a visitor’s mouse leaves the window or heads towards the close window button, an overlay pops up. Usually, this includes some sort of last-ditch attempt to get them to stay, or to at least get something out of their visit, like an email address.</p><p>The mentality of this is “they are already leaving the site, so there’s no harm in doing one last pitch to keep them around.” While this tactic isn’t the most offensive or off putting, it is commonly not employed very well. The visitor is already in the act of leaving, so any additional annoyance won’t have much effect. The only possible way you can make things worse is by giving out false promises or misleading your visitors in your overlay.</p><p>The major failing in most last-ditch effort overlays is what you are presenting. If a person is leaving your site after a few seconds, it’s likely they aren’t interested in your e-book or subscribing to your newsletter because your initial content wasn’t good enough.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>How to do it</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/6-exit-overlays/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">If you are going to do a last ditch effort</a>, try to make it as personal as possible. Don’t just have one broad overlay anytime a person’s cursor heads off the page; customize them for specific pages. Think about why people might be leaving that page, and make your overlay something that might speak to them.</p><p>For example, if you are looking for an overlay on a blog article and have written similar content, your overlay could point them in that direction. This would be in case the article they clicked on didn’t have the information they were looking for, but maybe something else you’ve created does. This could also work on product pages for e-commerce sites, pointing visitors to similar products they sell.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Use research and data</h2><p>As with any decision in marketing, get data to back up your choices. If you don’t have any data, perform A/B tests to get some. Don’t put up overlays just because some other marketer told you to — find out what benefits it can bring you. What worked for some other person might not work for your site. So many people jumped on the overlay and pop-up train, but haven’t thought through the impacts it can have. <a href=\"http://mbaonline.pepperdine.edu/resources/news-articles/understanding-the-types-of-marketing-research/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Perform marketing research</a> yourself and then corroborate your findings with outside data.</p><p>Overlays and pop-ups need to work both from a <a href=\"https://blog.kissmetrics.com/9-user-experience-pitfalls/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">UX and marketing point of view</a>. You can have great content, but if the user experience on your site is terrible, it won’t matter. The opposite is true too. You can have an awesome experience, but it will just seem pointless without good content.</p><p>Proper and intelligent use of overlays can lead to lowering bounce rates and converting more visitors, but only if done right. Abusing your visitors with bad pop-ups and interrupting their experience can only hurt your site. Take time and find ways they can work with your site or whether you need to rework your current overlays.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img class=\"pinterest-hidden aligncenter wp-image-30839 size-large\" src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/popups-and-overlays-PIN-min-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Are your pop-ups and overlays pushing away potential customers?\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/popups-and-overlays-PIN-min-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/popups-and-overlays-PIN-min-200x300.jpg 200w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/popups-and-overlays-PIN-min-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/popups-and-overlays-PIN-min-32x48.jpg 32w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/popups-and-overlays-PIN-min-223x334.jpg 223w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/popups-and-overlays-PIN-min-600x900.jpg 600w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/popups-and-overlays-PIN-min-315x472.jpg 315w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/10/popups-and-overlays-PIN-min.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\"/></p><div class=\"wp_rp_wrap wp_rp_vertical_m\" ><div class=\"wp_rp_content\"><h3 class=\"related_post_title\">Related posts</h3><ul class=\"related_post wp_rp\"><li data-position=\"0\" data-poid=\"in-29040\" data-post-type=\"none\" ><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/lead-magnets.html\" class=\"wp_rp_thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/04/lead-magnets-min-315x158.png\" alt=\"Lead Magnets: What They Are and How to Use Them\" width=\"315\"/></a><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/lead-magnets.html\" class=\"wp_rp_title\">Lead Magnets: What They Are and How to Use Them</a></li><li data-position=\"1\" data-poid=\"in-29486\" data-post-type=\"none\" ><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/creating-magnetic-blog.html\" class=\"wp_rp_thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/05/magnetic-blog-min-315x158.png\" alt=\"9 Steps to Creating a Magnetic Blog\" width=\"315\"/></a><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/creating-magnetic-blog.html\" class=\"wp_rp_title\">9 Steps to Creating a Magnetic Blog</a></li></ul></div></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/pop-ups-overlays-pushing-away-potential-customers.html\">Are Your Pop-ups and Overlays Pushing Away Potential Customers?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com\">GetResponse Blog - Online Marketing Tips</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"https://blog.getresponse.com/pop-ups-overlays-pushing-away-potential-customers.html/feed\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"            \";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"10 Unbeatable Marketing Conferences in the USA to Close Out 2017\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"https://blog.getresponse.com/marketing-conferences-usa-close-out-2017.html\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"https://blog.getresponse.com/marketing-conferences-usa-close-out-2017.html#respond\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 28 Sep 2017 15:36:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"MARKETING\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"https://blog.getresponse.com/?p=30823\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:672:\"<p>There’s nothing quite like top-tier marketing conferences, and there’s no shortage of great ones taking place all the time across the USA.

We had a great group of attendees who asked some awesome questions. And here’s a chance for us to answer the most frequent ones.</p><p><span id=\"more-30816\"></span></p><h2>A/B Testing</h2><p>The A/B testing feature in email is a way to let you send two slightly different emails to your audience. You can then see which version generated more engagement and then send the most effective email to the rest of your list.</p><p>Before you begin, it might be helpful to review some guidelines for <a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/ab-tests-scientifically.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">effective A/B testing</a>.</p><ol><li><strong>Only conduct one test at a time</strong><strong>.</strong> If you test an email campaign that directs people to a landing page at the same time that you’re A/B testing that landing page, your results can get muddled pretty easily. How will you know which change caused the increase in leads?</li><li><strong>Test one variable at a time.</strong> In order to evaluate how effective an element of your page is, you have to isolate that variable in your A/B test. Only test one element at a time – so either an email, or the landing page you’re sending your audience to.</li><li><strong>Test minor changes, too</strong><strong>.</strong> Although it’s reasonable to think that big, sweeping changes can increase your click numbers, the small details are often just as important. While creating your tests, remember that even a simple change, say, switching an image in your email, or using a different subject line, can drive big improvements. In fact, these sorts of changes are usually easier to measure than the bigger ones.</li><li><strong>You can A/B test the entire element</strong>. While you can certainly test a button color or a background shade, you should also consider making your entire email a variable. Instead of testing single design elements, such as headlines, subject lines, and images, design two completely different emails and test them against each other. Now you’re working on a higher level. This type of testing yields the biggest improvements, so consider starting with it before you continue your optimization with smaller tweaks.</li><li><strong>Measure as far down the funnel as possible</strong>. Sure, your A/B test might have a positive impact on your email click rate, but how about your sales numbers? A/B testing can have a significant effect on your bottom line. You may even see that an email with fewer clicks produced more sales. As you create your A/B test, consider how it affects metrics such as open rates or click rates that will contribute to you achieving your KPIs.</li><li><strong>Decide what you want to test</strong>. As you optimize your email, there are a number of variables you can test. You don’t have to limit yourself to testing only images or text size. Look at the various elements on your marketing resources and their possible alternatives for design, wording, or layout. In fact, some of the areas you can test might not be instantly recognizable. For instance, you can test different subject lines, senders, or ways to personalize the message.</li><li><strong>Split your sample group randomly.</strong> In order to achieve conclusive results, you need to test with two or more audiences that are equal. At GetResponse, we automatically split traffic to your variations so that each variation gets a random sampling of visitors.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Segmenting your audience</h2><p>Marketers know that segmenting email marketing lists can improve open and click-through rates. That said, figuring out the best way to segment your email marketing lists can be a huge undertaking.</p><p>To make it a little less overwhelming, here are a few quick ways to get you on the right segmentation track.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>1. Demographics</h3><p>The first way many marketers begin email marketing segmentation is by using demographic data. Information such as age, gender, company position, and income level can say a lot about a person’s needs and interests.</p><p>The more information you can get about your audience in the signup process, the more options you’ll have for demographic segmentation. Be careful with this, though, because asking for too much information can scare people off from signing up at all.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>2. Email engagement</h3><p>Email engagement is another very basic way to segment your list that can have a huge impact on your overall results. Open rate and click rate are the main metrics here that you keep track of in your email marketing service.</p><p>You can segment by engagement by designating active vs. inactive users, such as someone who hasn’t opened your emails in three months. You can then create a specialized campaign designed at re-engaging your inactive subscribers. This is perfect for those of you who take off with little subscriber data.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>3. Geolocation</h3><p>There are a lot of different ways to use geographic location data, making segmentation by geographic area a valuable tool – especially for businesses where location greatly influences purchasing decisions, or the availability of offers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>4. Website visits</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Keeping track of website behavior is another simple way to get more information about visitors’ interests. For example, you can send targeted emails based on the specific pages they visited – but that’s far from the only option. You can set up goals at GetResponse and segment your audience according to:</p><ul><li>pages people visited</li><li>pages they didn’t visit</li><li>people who visited one page but missed another related page</li><li>what videos they watched (and how long they watched them), or what content they read</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Newsletter optimization sessions:</h2><p>Whenever you send a newsletter, always try to keep in mind your what your goals are, what you’d like your audience to do, and who your targeted audience actually is. As to improving the readability and reach of your emails, make sure you remember about:</p><ol><li>familiarity – always follow your brand’s voice and scent</li><li>sleek, simple designs – keep a clear header hierarchy, don’t use multiple font types, if you don’t need to</li><li>less is more – focus your email around one, clear call to action to shorten your contact’s path to conversion. Even if you’re just sending informational newsletters.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Conclusion:</h2><p>A/B tests and segmentation are great ways to drive your audience’s engagement and literally achieve more with email marketing. However, I know not all of you may have the time to do it all, among your daily marketing activities. Trust me, working with email right now I may be a little spoiled, but I wore many, many marketing hats before. And I know finding the time for it is not always easy. So start small and most of all – keep trying. Don’t be afraid to change the ways you communicate with your audience.</p><p><img class=\"pinterest-hidden aligncenter wp-image-30818 size-large\" src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/09/AB-Testing-PIN-min-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"A/B Test Your Way to Success\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/09/AB-Testing-PIN-min-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/09/AB-Testing-PIN-min-200x300.jpg 200w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/09/AB-Testing-PIN-min-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/09/AB-Testing-PIN-min-32x48.jpg 32w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/09/AB-Testing-PIN-min-223x334.jpg 223w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/09/AB-Testing-PIN-min-600x900.jpg 600w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/09/AB-Testing-PIN-min-315x472.jpg 315w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/09/AB-Testing-PIN-min.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\"/></p><div class=\"wp_rp_wrap wp_rp_vertical_m\" ><div class=\"wp_rp_content\"><h3 class=\"related_post_title\">Related posts</h3><ul class=\"related_post wp_rp\"><li data-position=\"0\" data-poid=\"in-29566\" data-post-type=\"none\" ><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/unconventional-ways-improve-conversion-rates.html\" class=\"wp_rp_thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/05/improve-conversion-rates-min-315x158.png\" alt=\"Four Unconventional Ways to Improve Conversion Rates\" width=\"315\"/></a><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/unconventional-ways-improve-conversion-rates.html\" class=\"wp_rp_title\">Four Unconventional Ways to Improve Conversion Rates</a></li><li data-position=\"1\" data-poid=\"in-29027\" data-post-type=\"none\" ><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/new-mobile-workspace.html\" class=\"wp_rp_thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/04/1600x800-min-315x158.png\" alt=\"Announcing the New Mobile Workspace for Landing Pages\" width=\"315\"/></a><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/new-mobile-workspace.html\" class=\"wp_rp_title\">Announcing the New Mobile Workspace for Landing Pages</a></li></ul></div></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/webinar-recap-ab-test-way-email-success.html\">Webinar Recap: A/B Test Your Way to Email Success</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com\">GetResponse Blog - Online Marketing Tips</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"https://blog.getresponse.com/webinar-recap-ab-test-way-email-success.html/feed\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"            \";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"Social, the Ecommerce Multiplier\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"https://blog.getresponse.com/social-ecommerce-multiplier.html\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://blog.getresponse.com/social-ecommerce-multiplier.html#respond\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 26 Sep 2017 19:26:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"MARKETING\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"https://blog.getresponse.com/?p=30807\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:602:\"<p>Email, SEO, PPC and web design are all different tools that are used in ecommerce, and all provide different functions.

Social media is another tool for digital marketers &#8211; but it’s a very special tool. It does what it does very well. It helps grow audiences, build brand awareness, extends reach and is a cost-effective method of conversion.</p><p><span id=\"more-30807\"></span></p><p>What makes it special is that it helps other forms of <a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/6-success-factors-ecommerce-business-strategy.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ecommerce</a> improve while still doing the job you’re using it for. Social media marketing can help make your email, PPC, SEO and even website design better. Most importantly, it can grow your business. It does this in two ways. Firstly, it can enhance your existing ecommerce marketing to get more customers. Secondly, it can pick up customers that you might otherwise have lost through retargeting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>1. How social enhances ecommerce</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Email + Social Media</h3><p>Email is the backbone of ecommerce. It’s where transactions on the Internet started, and it’s still where a lot of digital communication takes place. As it has been going for 30 years now, long standing companies have built up large databases of customer emails, and these can be imported into Facebook to create your audience. Using Facebook Insights and other tools, you can then find lookalike audiences who you can target with ads.</p><p>These targeted audiences are much more likely to like your business, as they already share the same tastes as your returning customer base.  Social media can also be used to populate your email database. If you give an exclusive special offer, or give something like a free eBook if they give their email address &#8211; then you can build up your email list.</p><p>Social media also works best when it’s brief and engaging. If you write a post on Facebook or Twitter, it’s generally recommended that you keep between 80 and 100 characters. That’s great practice for writing great email titles and an engaging first sentence that will show up in the inbox and entice people to open and engage with your email. Emoji are effective too!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>SEO + social media</h3><p>Social media is extremely useful for SEO. One of the ways that you can improve your SERPs is by creating backlinks to other sites. Every social signal &#8211; something like a tweet or a share of content you have on your social media &#8211; may contribute towards your SERPS. That means the better your social content is, and the more times it’s shared, the better your SEO ranking. Companies that have an active social media presence generally have better SERPs.</p><p>If you use blogs as a way to generate backlinks, they can also be used as content in your social feed. As well as the backlinks generated through the blogs, you get the multiplying effect of social media drawing people to that content &#8211; and if it’s good enough, sharing it and generating even more of an SEO boost.</p><p>You can also use different approaches on different social media platforms to promote your content from different angles. A B2B article is likely to get a lot more interest on a social media site like LinkedIn &#8211; whereas a fun blog for ‘10 unexpected benefits of [your business]’ might play better on Facebook. Remember to keep the blog tied in with your core values.</p><p>Those  who are practiced in SEO know the value of using keywords and being concise. Those skills are directly transferrable to social media. They are important because they give your social copy purpose and relevance, and even more so if they are to be the basis for backlink generation that will effectively increase your SERP.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><table style=\"height: 11px;\" width=\"908\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"width: 898px;\"><strong><em>Want to sell more products?

In terms of content, you have to be laser focused on getting your message out as quickly as possible. Unsurprisingly, tactics like special offers and money off that work well in PPC also work well in Facebook and other social media &#8211; but they work together too.</p><p>A PPC link will drive people to the website’s landing page. On that landing page, you can also have links to your social media. If you have a strong social media following, you can also embed that social media within your website &#8211; so that people can instantly see the interaction you have with your audience, and the recommendations that come from real people. It will make them more likely to trust the site and take the next step. It also means that PPC can drive people to a website, but also drive them to social media.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>2. Retargeting and remarketing</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Getting more customers with social media</h3><p>Once social media, email, SEO and PPC has helped you get more customers or email inquiries, you can use your email list alongside social media like Facebook to find brand new audiences. You can import your email list into a custom audience. Using that you can remarket to people on that list through Facebook ads.</p><p>The other benefit is that you can create lookalike audiences from that custom audience. These are people who have similar interests and demographic markers as people who have already bought from you. This means that they are much more likely to convert than people who are targeted on broad demographic lines.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Retargeting</h3><p>Usually in a sales funnel, you expect to lose audience members at each stage. Not everyone in the total audience you approach will be attracted to your product, less will be interested, even less will make the decision to interact and fewer still will turn that decision into an action to convert.</p><p>But there’s something else you can put on your landing page. A Facebook Pixel (other pixels are available). That’s a small piece of code which can track people once they’ve visited your site. If you ever wondered how Amazon targeted you with ads after you looked at a product on their site &#8211; now you know how.</p><p><em>Attraction, Interest, Decision, Action: AIDA.</em> We all know the funnel. Using a pixel, customers who would otherwise have been lost can be retargeted. A customer who showed interest by visiting a website has already made their way along part of the customer journey. The pixel can track this, and give them another piece of contact design to move them down the sales funnel.</p><p>Retargeting is more successful at converting than regular targeting, as once someone has interacted with your company once, then they are more likely to interact with you again. Using Ad Manager, you can automate retargeting based on the interaction people have had with the website. If they haven’t clicked through, you can give them an incentive to click through.</p><p>If they have been on the website, you can show them some pictures of products they might like to get them to interact further. If they have looked at a certain product and backed out &#8211; you can give them a time sensitive special offer. The further down the funnel the people go, the more successful the conversion rate of retargeting is. The differing messages also mean the customers don’t suffer from ad fatigue.</p><p><strong>  </strong></p><h2><strong>Social, the ecommerce multiplier</strong></h2><p>People go online to solve a problem or be entertained. The old tools of ecommerce are still effective at solving people’s problems online. If someone searches for something they need, SEO and PPC are still going to be effective at getting people’s attention. What they are not as good as are being proactive &#8211; of getting their business out there to people who might need it &#8211; not those that already do.</p><p>Social media is very good at meeting people where their attention already is. On the devices where their attention already is. If the content is good, it can speak to them directly in a language they understand and appreciate. That building of trust and brand awareness is great for growing a company &#8211; and it supports the other tools of ecommerce. It builds email lists, it strengthens SEO and it makes PPC more effective. Social media isn’t a competitor for ecommerce &#8211; it’s a supercharger.</p><p>By the same token, people who have excellent social media followings, but poor PPC, SEO and email strategies will not be getting the most out of their digital marketing. This engine works best when it’s firing on all cylinders. Making all these moving parts work together may seem complicated &#8211; people don’t often think of things like consistency of tone, message and design language across email, social and websites &#8211; but when these things are in place, the customers can tell. The customers respond. The customers will help you grow your business.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img class=\"pinterest-hidden aligncenter wp-image-30811 size-large\" src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/09/eCommerce-multiplier-PIN-min-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"social media, the ecommerce multiplier\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/09/eCommerce-multiplier-PIN-min-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/09/eCommerce-multiplier-PIN-min-200x300.jpg 200w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/09/eCommerce-multiplier-PIN-min-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/09/eCommerce-multiplier-PIN-min-32x48.jpg 32w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/09/eCommerce-multiplier-PIN-min-223x334.jpg 223w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/09/eCommerce-multiplier-PIN-min-600x900.jpg 600w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/09/eCommerce-multiplier-PIN-min-315x472.jpg 315w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/09/eCommerce-multiplier-PIN-min.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\"/></p><div class=\"wp_rp_wrap wp_rp_vertical_m\" ><div class=\"wp_rp_content\"><h3 class=\"related_post_title\">Related posts</h3><ul class=\"related_post wp_rp\"><li data-position=\"0\" data-poid=\"in-29486\" data-post-type=\"none\" ><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/creating-magnetic-blog.html\" class=\"wp_rp_thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/05/magnetic-blog-min-315x158.png\" alt=\"9 Steps to Creating a Magnetic Blog\" width=\"315\"/></a><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/creating-magnetic-blog.html\" class=\"wp_rp_title\">9 Steps to Creating a Magnetic Blog</a></li><li data-position=\"1\" data-poid=\"in-29533\" data-post-type=\"none\" ><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/align-content-marketing-strategy-mission.html\" class=\"wp_rp_thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/05/align-content-marketing-to-mission-min-315x158.png\" alt=\"4 Ways to Align Your Content Marketing Strategy With Your Mission\" width=\"315\"/></a><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/align-content-marketing-strategy-mission.html\" class=\"wp_rp_title\">4 Ways to Align Your Content Marketing Strategy With Your Mission</a></li></ul></div></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/social-ecommerce-multiplier.html\">Social, the Ecommerce Multiplier</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com\">GetResponse Blog - Online Marketing Tips</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"https://blog.getresponse.com/social-ecommerce-multiplier.html/feed\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"            \";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"Content Marketers: Stop Creating and Start Documenting\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"https://blog.getresponse.com/start-documenting.html\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"https://blog.getresponse.com/start-documenting.html#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 25 Sep 2017 17:25:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"MARKETING\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"https://blog.getresponse.com/?p=30786\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:623:\"<p>In the quest to be heard, it is important to gain your audience’s attention and make sure that you have something of interest to say. This is certainly a mindset that drives content marketers in the modern age, who are constantly striving to target customers through the creation of engaging blog posts, white papers and infographics.

But what is this, and how can you put it into action?</p><h2></h2><h2>Stop creating and start documenting</h2><p>This solution requires you to change your perspective when creating content, as you document practical experiences and real-time developments within your business rather than attempting to find unique stories or narratives. This enables you to strike the ideal balance between the uniqueness and the frequency of your publications, as you can tap into your brand’s journey and a never-ending stream of potential ideas.</p><p>As a result, you can focus on promoting your brand and creating genuine awareness, while speaking authoritatively about something that you have first-hand experience of.</p><p>There is also the issue of authenticity, which was the focus of a key 2013 study conducted by the Boston Consulting Group. The results confirmed that <a href=\"https://www.visioncritical.com/authenticity-stats/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">customers identified authenticity as one of the top qualities</a> that would attract them to a brand, while audiences are increasingly suspicious of larger corporations and the way in which they utilize content. The notion of documenting an authentic brand journey taps into this, creating a relatable and believable story that customers can buy into.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>How can you successfully generate content through documenting?</h2><p>As you can see, there are obvious benefits to documenting your brand’s journey. In order to capitalize on these, you will need to <a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/growth-hacking-social-media.html\">embrace numerous social media channels</a> while also ensuring that you publish frequently and on a daily basis. Here are some practical steps that will help you to achieve your objectives:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Focus on the attributes, struggles and challenges that define your business</h2><p>While you may not have to spend as much time brainstorming when documenting your brand and its journey, there is still a need to explore relevant themes and develop a viable content strategy. This ensures that you are able to engage customers over a sustained period of time, while also detailing the characteristics, narratives and challenges that make your brand unique.</p><p>Documenting the daily challenges that impact on your business can be particularly effective, as this can help to humanize the brand in the eyes of customers and deliver actionable content that others can learn from. Let’s say that you’re a startup digital marketing brand that is striving to obtain 10,000 Twitter followers, pursuing alternative strategies to achieve this goal.</p><p>By documenting your efforts and the experiences of the individuals who are implementing these, you can organically promote your core services while also sharing the type of challenges and aspirations that followers can identify with. The same principle can be applied to product-oriented brands, who can use video to narrate the development of ideas as they brought to life and then to market.</p><p>You could achieve a similar aim by encouraging employees to write, record and publish daily diaries for the company blog. The combination of video and text is extremely engaging, while this type of documentation enables you to cover a wider range of commercial challenges and developments. These diary entries can also be used as part of an ongoing and longer-form series of publications, which can help to cultivate loyalty and a genuine interest in the brand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Aim to produce 5+ pieces of content each day</h2><p>We have already touched on the importance of frequency, and you and your brand should strive to publish approximately six or seven pieces of meaningful pieces of documented content each day.</p><p>This is central to any content marketing campaign, as it is a proactive and consistent approach to publishing that ultimately builds brand awareness, cultivates relationships through thought leadership and successfully converts leads.</p><p>It is also important that you use an integrated social platform to share your content, focusing on the behavior of your core users and embracing relatively new platforms such as Snapchat and Instagram.</p><p>Aside from your own company blog, these two platforms should as serve as staple publication resources, along with Facebook (and the live streaming channel Facebook Live) and YouTube. Snapchat is particularly relevant due to <a href=\"https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-snapchat-story-3486000\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">its unique storytelling feature</a>, which allows you to use images and video to document daily events that occur within your business. Not only does this leverage various elements of rich media, but the fact that narratives are deleted after 24 hours lends a sense of urgency that compels followers to share.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.eofire.com/how-to-podcast/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Podcasting</a> is also an exceptional way of documenting the discussions and meetings that take place within your business, both in terms of content and medium. An estimated <a href=\"https://newmediaeurope.com/uk-podcast-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">4.7 million adults in the UK are thought to have listened to a podcast</a>, and this provides a growing audience for your brand to target.</p><p>You can also include niche social media channels depending on your core demographics, as you look to publish content that will resonate with your customers. <a href=\"https://www.omnicoreagency.com/pinterest-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">An estimated 81% of Pinterest users are women</a>, so this is ideal for brands that wish to document their journey and appeal to a largely female audience.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>In summary: why documenting can help your brand grow</h2><p>In the digital age, Millennials have emerged as the single most dominant and influential consumer group. This has helped to underpin the rise of content marketing in recent times, while 62% of Millennials also <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/matthew-tyson/millennials-want-brands-t_b_9032718.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">expect brands to engage them regularly</a> through various social media networks.</p><p>This has encouraged many brands to begin an obsessive pursuit of innovative content, which has proved increasingly difficult in an age where social media is saturated with branded copy, videos and images.</p><p>This why documentation is such an effective alternative, as it provides truly unique content that can promote your brand organically while sharing a telling insight into the daily events at a thriving business.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img class=\"pinterest-hidden aligncenter wp-image-30790 size-large\" src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/09/start-documenting-PIN-min-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"stop creating and start documenting your content marketing\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/09/start-documenting-PIN-min-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/09/start-documenting-PIN-min-200x300.jpg 200w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/09/start-documenting-PIN-min-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/09/start-documenting-PIN-min-32x48.jpg 32w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/09/start-documenting-PIN-min-223x334.jpg 223w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/09/start-documenting-PIN-min-600x900.jpg 600w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/09/start-documenting-PIN-min-315x472.jpg 315w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/09/start-documenting-PIN-min.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\"/></p><div class=\"wp_rp_wrap wp_rp_vertical_m\" ><div class=\"wp_rp_content\"><h3 class=\"related_post_title\">Related posts</h3><ul class=\"related_post wp_rp\"><li data-position=\"0\" data-poid=\"in-29203\" data-post-type=\"none\" ><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/brand-voice.html\" class=\"wp_rp_thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/04/brand-voice-min-315x158.png\" alt=\"Do You Know Your Brand Voice?\" width=\"315\"/></a><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/brand-voice.html\" class=\"wp_rp_title\">Do You Know Your Brand Voice?</a></li><li data-position=\"1\" data-poid=\"in-28848\" data-post-type=\"none\" ><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/content-strategies-buyers-journey.html\" class=\"wp_rp_thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/04/buyersjourney-min-315x158.png\" alt=\"Content Strategies to Nurture Prospects Along the Buyer’s Journey\" width=\"315\"/></a><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/content-strategies-buyers-journey.html\" class=\"wp_rp_title\">Content Strategies to Nurture Prospects Along the Buyer’s Journey</a></li></ul></div></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/start-documenting.html\">Content Marketers: Stop Creating and Start Documenting</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com\">GetResponse Blog -

This is when a mental health day comes to the rescue. It’s a day free of work to give your mind, body, and spirit what they are craving most.</p><p><span id=\"more-30760\"></span></p><p>The topic of mental health day is burning hot this summer. It’s been recently covered in the articles by <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/amymorin/2017/07/12/how-to-know-when-you-need-a-mental-health-day/#2677d3cd187e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Forbes</a>, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/mind/do-need-mental-health-sick-day-do-ask-one/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Telegraph</a>, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mental-health-day-benefits_us_5767f4d0e4b0853f8bf15a33\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Huffington Post</a> and other top media resources. These posts convince us it&#8217;s OK to take a day off not only when you are feeling sick physically, but also when you are on the verge of mental exhaustion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>When it&#8217;s a good idea to take a mental health day?</h2><p>I used to work with a colleague who confessed once that every morning he hopes he gets into a car accident so he doesn’t have to go to work. If you feeling the same way, you definitely need a mental health day.</p><p>Same goes to if you consistently feel anxious or nervous and can’t concentrate at work. If you have ongoing mental health issues that you need to care for, you should take a sick leave without feeling guilty.</p><p>Once you’ve decided you need a day off to take care of your mental state, make sure your absence won’t be disastrous to your team at work.</p><p>I’ve read a bunch of articles on why and when you should take a mental health day. However, there isn’t much information on the net what you should actually be doing during this day to get yourself fully refreshed.</p><p>The following tips are based on the personal experience (yes, I’ve taken a day off work right before writing this post), talking to people who’ve taken a day off due to mental health issues and an in-depth analysis of various studies on physiological health.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Things to do during your mental health day off:</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>1. Become an excessive sleeper for a day.</h3><p>If you are like <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/p0215-enough-sleep.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">35% of U.S. adults who suffer from sleep deprivation</a> or worse, insomnia, you have a first-hand experience on how the lack of sleep lowers your productivity at work. Therefore, put the shades down, turn off the alarm and catch up on your lost sleep.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>2. Stop the notification distraction.</h3><p>An innocent ping on your phone may significantly increase the level of stress and frustration. The <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2017/technology-social-media.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study by American Psychological Association</a> shows that <strong>constant phone checkers have a 20% higher stress level</strong> compared to those who don’t look at their device every minute. A day without a phone can seriously reduce the level of anxiety. However, if you suffer from nomophobia (the fear or being without your phone), the least you can do for your stressed-out mind is to turn the notifications off.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><h3>3. Do something different.</h3><p>Did you know that the neural pathways in the brain begin to solidify <a href=\"http://www.thealternativedaily.com/creating-neural-path-brain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">by age 25</a>? Unfortunately, as we get older, our brain tends to lose flexibility and plasticity which explains why we can’t learn as fast as kids any more. Luckily, with a little effort, we can challenge ourselves. Doing new things, visiting new places and obtaining new habits makes our brain work in a different mode, creating new neural pathways. That’s exactly the reason why people feel younger when they travel.</p><p>Do something you wouldn’t normally do during your working day or even a weekend. Start with simple things like sleeping in another room in your house and taking the stairs rather than an elevator. Here’s a list with <a href=\"http://www.mazzastick.com/feeling-out-of-sorts-lately-try-doing-something-new-for-30-days/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">50 ideas on doing something new</a> that could help you out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>4. Read a good book.</h3><p>Not a book you need to read for work. Forget all the “How to be a great boss” or “100 ways to boost productivity” editions and choose something that brings you real joy either it’s some kind of gutter press, nerdy stuff or a chick flick book. If you have no idea what to read, here’s a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/books-help-with-anxiety_us_5702702de4b0a06d58061aa1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">selection of great books</a> from Katherine Brooks that are meant to deal with your anxiety.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>5. Get outdoors.</h3><p>We are all the children of nature. Fresh air, green trees, sunshine and raindrops is where we really belong, not the stuffy office. Getting outside and enjoying the nature helps you remind yourself who you truly are and who you want to be. Fresh air will do you good – it improves your blood pressure, strengthens your immune system, cleans your lungs, gives you more energy and makes you a happier person.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>6. Try a new workout routine.</h3><p>You knew this one was coming didn’t you? Well, it’s hard to underestimate the power of physical activity and its impact on your mental health. While the need for regular exercises goes without saying, the mental health day off is a great time to try something new. It would be great to do a different type of workout than your normally do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>7. Treat yourself with a good, healthy meal.</h3><p>While temptation to lock in your room with a bucket of ice cream might be staring you in the face, unhealthy foods won’t give your mental health a break unless you are on a strict diet. You will feel far more refreshed if you go with a healthy yet tasty cuisine. Don’t eat anything you don’t like or enjoy though. Here is a <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/real-healing/201301/healthy-gut-healthy-mind-5-foods-improve-mental-health\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">list of products</a> that improve mental health to help you decide on the menu.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>8. Get into water.</h3><p>Either it’s a hot tub in the winter or a dive into a refreshing pool in the summer, any type of water activities is great when it comes to stress and anxiety relief. If you choose to go to the beach or the pool, don’t get too much sun. When we spent a day out at the baking sun with my friend during our day off, we started to get jealous of our colleagues working at the chilly office at that time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, drinking enough water is essential for releasing stress. The thing is, even a small degree of dehydration can increase the level of cortisol (the stress hormone) in your body. Therefore, make sure to drink enough water and keep the stress away.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>9. Meet up with your friends or spend a day alone.</h3><p>It depends on the type of person you are and the work you do whether you ache for communication or can’t stand it. I personally know a sales manager who dreams of spending a day alone in a complete silence. At the same time some of my software development friends crave for a company and communication. Whatever you are missing – go for it during your mental health day.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>10. It’s time to go for extreme things.</h3><p>If everything else doesn’t work, this will definitely clear your brain. Think what’s extreme for you. It doesn’t necessarily have to be skydiving (in case you are dreading it like I do). Maybe it’s dying your hair purple or going caving overnight. As long as it gives you shivers of excitement, go for it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Taking a day off doesn’t guarantee you a mental makeover. The good news is it totally depends on you. Take an advantage of this day making it special and unforgettable. Fill it with positive emotions, plenty of sleep, new exciting things and places. Stop all the distractions and set yourself to a complete refresh.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Companies may seriously benefit from introducing mental health days off to their employees. In the long run, the overall work efficiency will only go up. Your body and mind will be definitely thankful for recharging the batteries. If you follow these tips, you should notice an incredible boost of productivity the following day.</p><p>What about you? Have you already taken a mental health day?

We all have experienced the frustration of not getting the results we’d hoped for out of our marketing efforts. And yeah, it <em>is</em> frustrating! How can you get over that frustration?</p><ol><li>Keep doing what you’re doing</li><li>Try something different</li><li>Watch cat videos.

Paid search is best defined as advertising campaigns that you run on Google and/or Bing. And if you’re not familiar with online display ads, you may be more familiar with the term banner ads – it’s the same thing. Influencer marketing is forming a promotional partnership with someone with a large audience where you cooperate to promote each other’s work. Marketing automation is, simply put, email marketing on steroids (and what the good folks at GetResponse are so good at). And paid social is running advertising or boosting the content you post on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter.</p><p>If you’re looking to expand your digital marketing activities, this webinar is for you.

When it comes to targeted traffic to their websites and revenue generated there has been no looking back at all.</p><p><span id=\"more-30746\"></span></p><p>Social media is an excellent tool for businesses today to grow and establish their brand presence in the market. However, when it comes to the use of social media for their market needs and promotion, most entrepreneurs are not even aware of how to use it correctly. This is why they get no results and abandon social media entirely for their promotion and marketing uses. Lack of understanding is the key issue that makes them leave social media for the benefits of their company and business.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Why is social media popular today?</h2><p>There are solid reasons as to why you as an entrepreneur should embrace <a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/social-media-mistakes.html\">social media for your business</a> today. The following are the primary reasons for you to embrace social media and make it a part and parcel of your business:</p><ul><li><strong>Wide platform –</strong> it gives you a comprehensive platform, and this is why you should use it for promoting your brand. You can provide followers descriptions of your product or service. Post images and videos of them to invoke trust.</li><li><strong>Cost effective –</strong>  platforms are free and if you want you can make an affordable social media ad to market them to your followers and their network. The costs of these ads are cheaper over conventional advertisements for your brand or product.</li><li><strong>Accessibility –</strong> platforms are accessed by people from all across the globe. All you need to do is create an account and make a business page for your company. All updates, content, and posts can be uploaded and shared with ease.</li><li><strong>Reach –</strong> it helps you to transcend local barriers when it comes to customer reach. In fact, when customers get regular posts and updates from your end, brand loyalty increases. This goes a very long way to make your presence felt in the market.</li></ul><p>It is a useful tool when it comes to your business promotion and marketing. No matter how big or large your business might be, it is prudent for you to create a profile on prominent <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaysondemers/2014/08/11/the-top-10-benefits-of-social-media-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">social media platforms</a> like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google Plus, etc.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Education and awareness</h2><p>Companies and businesses claim that when it comes to social media marketing and promotion, the platforms help them in spreading awareness and education. If you take a look at people today, they will log into their social media platforms at least three to four times a week. Some people have social apps installed on their smartphones, and this gives them the chance to check their social pages even every time they receive a notification. This is an added advantage to the company specializing in a particular niche to reach out to their followers and spread information and knowledge about their services and products.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Social media improves your visibility</strong></h2><p>With the help of the above social media pages, you can establish and invoke your visibility. This primarily helps you to get the best for your needs. At the same time, when you take a look at social media platforms, you will find that if any of your followers find your post or content interesting or engaging, they share your posts with their followers. This chain is created, and so you get better visibility on the search engine ranks. This boosts search engine optimization and the chances of you receiving better-targeted traffic and profits.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Invokes trust and confidence</h2><p>In addition to online visibility, social media pages also help you to invoke confidence in the market. You can help your followers with recent news and updates. You can give you practical solutions especially if you are dealing in a niche where education and awareness are important. For example, in the case of <a href=\"https://www.nationaldebtrelief.com/debt-consolidation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">business debts</a>, you might need some guidance as to how to apply or even repay debts. Social media pages of debt relief companies will give you information on useful tools like debt consolidation services that will help you understand the process and procedures for repayment of all your debts without tensions and stress.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Reputation for your company</h2><p>It is important for you to open an account on social media platforms and begin to communicate with your followers to give them a personal touch. This will help you receive feedback from customers and clients for the improvement of your services and products. Moreover, when you receive real feedback from your customers or clients, you get the chance to improve and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141117141329-95771085-8-ways-to-build-trust-in-your-brand-through-social-media\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">innovate your business</a>. Even their ideas and suggestions can promote massive transformation in your business.</p><p>Therefore, social media platforms are indispensable for the development and the growth of your business today. Reap their benefits and connect with your customers or clients in real. With this simple gesture and some amount of time on your social media platform, you can improve brand awareness, customer loyalty, consistent revenue, web presence and targeted traffic on your website without any hassles at all!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img class=\"pinterest-hidden aligncenter wp-image-30750 size-large\" src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/09/social-media-biz-growth-PIN-min-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"learn how social media can help entrepreneurs grow their business\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/09/social-media-biz-growth-PIN-min-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/09/social-media-biz-growth-PIN-min-200x300.jpg 200w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/09/social-media-biz-growth-PIN-min-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/09/social-media-biz-growth-PIN-min-32x48.jpg 32w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/09/social-media-biz-growth-PIN-min-223x334.jpg 223w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/09/social-media-biz-growth-PIN-min-600x900.jpg 600w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/09/social-media-biz-growth-PIN-min-315x472.jpg 315w, https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/09/social-media-biz-growth-PIN-min.jpg 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\"/></p><div class=\"wp_rp_wrap wp_rp_vertical_m\" ><div class=\"wp_rp_content\"><h3 class=\"related_post_title\">Related posts</h3><ul class=\"related_post wp_rp\"><li data-position=\"0\" data-poid=\"in-29486\" data-post-type=\"none\" ><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/creating-magnetic-blog.html\" class=\"wp_rp_thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/05/magnetic-blog-min-315x158.png\" alt=\"9 Steps to Creating a Magnetic Blog\" width=\"315\"/></a><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/creating-magnetic-blog.html\" class=\"wp_rp_title\">9 Steps to Creating a Magnetic Blog</a></li><li data-position=\"1\" data-poid=\"in-29480\" data-post-type=\"none\" ><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/social-media-monitoring-generate-leads.html\" class=\"wp_rp_thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2017/05/social-media-monitoring-min-315x158.png\" alt=\"How Social Media Monitoring Can Generate Leads\" width=\"315\"/></a><a href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/social-media-monitoring-generate-leads.html\" class=\"wp_rp_title\">How Social Media Monitoring Can Generate Leads</a></li></ul></div></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com/social-media-marketing-business-growth.html\">Implementing Social Media Marketing to See Exponential Business Growth</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.getresponse.com\">GetResponse Blog - Online Marketing Tips</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"https://blog.getresponse.com/social-media-marketing-business-growth.html/feed\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"            \";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"ResponseCon2017: Roundtable Events &amp;
